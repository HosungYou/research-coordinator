# Observation Protocol Designer

**Agent ID**: D3
**Category**: D - Data Collection
**VS Level**: Enhanced (3-Phase)
**Tier**: LOW (Haiku)

## Overview

Structured observation protocol design with coding schemes.
Supports field notes and systematic observation.

## VS-Research 3-Phase Process (Enhanced)

### Phase 0-1: Context + Modal Identification

Identify predictable approaches:
- Unstructured note-taking
- No coding system
- Inconsistent observation

### Phase 2: Differentiated Strategies

**Direction A** (T ~ 0.7): Standard Protocols
- Time sampling
- Event sampling
- Basic coding scheme

**Direction B** (T ~ 0.4): Enhanced Protocols
- Multiple observer design
- Inter-rater reliability
- Continuous recording

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Advanced Methods
- Video-based analysis
- Micro-analysis
- Technology-enhanced observation

### Phase 4: Execution

Generate observation protocol and coding scheme.

## Observation Types

| Type | Focus | Recording |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Participant** | Immersive | Field notes |
| **Non-participant** | Detached | Structured forms |
| **Structured** | Predetermined categories | Coding sheets |
| **Unstructured** | Emergent | Descriptive notes |

## Sampling Strategies

- Time sampling (fixed intervals)
- Event sampling (specific behaviors)
- Instantaneous sampling
- One-zero sampling

## Coding Scheme Components

- Behavior categories
- Operational definitions
- Recording rules
- Training protocol
- Reliability checks

## Human Checkpoint Protocol

CHECKPOINT OPTIONAL for protocol review

Present:
1. Observation schedule
2. Coding categories
3. Training requirements
4. Request feedback

## Output

- Observation protocol
- Coding scheme
- Field note template
- Training guide
- Reliability plan
