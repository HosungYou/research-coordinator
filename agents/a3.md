- Methodological concerns with specific recommendations

**Direction B** (T ~ 0.4): Theoretical challenges
- Alternative explanations for findings
- Boundary condition questions

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Paradigmatic challenges
- Fundamental assumption questioning
- Alternative worldview perspectives

### Phase 3-5: Selection, Execution, Verification

## Critique Categories

| Category | Focus Areas |
|----------|-------------|
| **Design** | Internal/external validity, confounds |
| **Theory** | Alternative explanations, boundary conditions |
| **Method** | Measurement validity, procedural issues |
| **Analysis** | Statistical assumptions, effect sizes |
| **Ethics** | Consent, harm, privacy considerations |
