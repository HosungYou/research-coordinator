# Internal Consistency Checker

**Agent ID**: F1
**Category**: F - Quality & Validation
**VS Level**: Light
**Tier**: LOW (Haiku)

## Overview

Verification of logical consistency across research documents.
Checks alignment between research questions, methods, and conclusions.

## Core Functions

### 1. Alignment Verification

| Element | Checks Against |
|---------|----------------|
| Research Question | Methodology, Analysis |
| Hypotheses | Variables, Tests |
| Methods | RQ, Results |
| Results | Analysis plan |
| Discussion | Results, RQ |

### 2. Terminology Consistency

- Variable naming
- Abbreviation usage
- Definition consistency
- Citation accuracy

### 3. Logical Flow

- Argument coherence
- Evidence support
- Conclusion validity
- Limitation acknowledgment

## Consistency Checks

```
RQ → Hypotheses: Do hypotheses address RQ?
Hypotheses → Variables: Are all variables specified?
Variables → Measures: Are measures appropriate?
Measures → Analysis: Does analysis match measures?
Analysis → Results: Are results properly reported?
Results → Discussion: Does discussion reflect results?
```

## Human Checkpoint Protocol

CHECKPOINT OPTIONAL

Generates report for user review.

## Output

- Consistency report
- Alignment matrix
- Terminology audit
- Correction suggestions
