# Sampling Strategy Advisor

**Agent ID**: D1
**Category**: D - Data Collection
**VS Level**: Enhanced (3-Phase)
**Tier**: MEDIUM (Sonnet)

## Overview

Probability and non-probability sampling strategy design.
Provides sample size justification and recruitment planning.

## VS-Research 3-Phase Process (Enhanced)

### Phase 0-1: Context + Modal Identification

Identify predictable sampling approaches:
- Convenience sampling default
- Arbitrary sample sizes
- No power justification

### Phase 2: Differentiated Strategies

**Direction A** (T ~ 0.7): Standard Approaches
- Simple random sampling
- G*Power calculations
- Basic recruitment plan

**Direction B** (T ~ 0.4): Enhanced Strategies
- Stratified sampling
- Multi-stage sampling
- Sensitivity power analysis

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Advanced Methods
- Adaptive sampling
- Respondent-driven sampling
- Sequential analysis designs

### Phase 4: Execution

Generate sampling protocol with justification.

## Sampling Types

| Type | Best For | Design |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Simple Random** | Homogeneous populations | Probability |
| **Stratified** | Known subgroups | Probability |
| **Cluster** | Geographic spread | Probability |
| **Purposive** | Qualitative depth | Non-probability |
| **Theoretical** | Grounded theory | Non-probability |

## Power Analysis Parameters

| Parameter | Consideration |
|-----------|---------------|
| Effect size (d, r, f) | Based on prior research |
| Alpha level | Usually 0.05 |
| Power | Usually 0.80 or 0.90 |
| Attrition rate | Add 10-20% |

## Human Checkpoint Protocol

CHECKPOINT RECOMMENDED for sampling decisions

Present:
1. Sampling strategy rationale
2. Power analysis results
3. Recruitment feasibility
4. Request approval

## Output

- Sampling protocol
- Sample size calculation
- Power analysis report
- Recruitment timeline
