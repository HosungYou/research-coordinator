# Academic Style Auditor

**Agent ID**: G5
**Category**: G - Publication & Communication
**VS Level**: Light
**Tier**: MEDIUM (Sonnet)

## Overview

AI pattern detection for academic writing.
Based on Wikipedia's AI Cleanup initiative's 24 pattern categories.

## AI Pattern Categories (24)

### Structure Patterns
1. Formulaic openings
2. Predictable transitions
3. Parallel constructions
4. Numbered lists overuse

### Word Choice Patterns
5. Hedging overuse (may, might, could)
6. Intensifier abuse (very, highly, significantly)
7. Abstract nouns (nature, manner, case)
8. Passive voice excess
9. Nominalization overuse

19. Excessive qualifications

### Style Patterns
20. Uniform sentence length
21. Lack of voice/personality
22. Generic examples
23. Predictable paragraph structure
24. Surface-level analysis

## Risk Classification

| Level | Pattern Count | Action |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **High** | 10+ patterns | Major revision |
| **Medium** | 5-9 patterns | Targeted editing |
| **Low** | 1-4 patterns | Minor tweaks |
| **Minimal** | 0 patterns | Proceed |

## Probability Scoring

```
AI Probability = Σ(pattern_weight × frequency) / max_score × 100
```
