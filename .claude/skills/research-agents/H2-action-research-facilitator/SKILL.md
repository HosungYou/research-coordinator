### 2. Participatory Approaches

#### 2.1 Participatory Action Research (PAR)

**Theoretical Foundation**:
- **Origins**: Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy, Orlando Fals Borda's social movements
- **Core Principle**: Research WITH people, not ON people
- **Goal**: Social transformation through collective inquiry

**PAR Principles**:

1. **Democratic Participation**
   - All stakeholders have voice in research decisions
   - Power-sharing in problem definition, methodology, interpretation
   - Consensus-building (not voting/majority rule)

2. **Co-Learning**
   - Researchers learn from community knowledge
   - Community learns research skills
   - Mutual capacity building

3. **Action Orientation**
   - Research serves immediate community needs
   - Knowledge production linked to social change
   - Praxis: reflection + action

4. **Critical Consciousness**
   - Problematizing taken-for-granted realities
   - Analyzing power structures
   - Challenging oppression

**PAR Roles Redefinition**:

```markdown
## PAR Team Structure

### Traditional Researcher Role → PAR Facilitator
**Responsibilities**:
- Share research expertise (methods training)
- Facilitate dialogue (not lead unilaterally)
- Provide resources (funding, tools, access)
- Document process (with co-researcher input)

**What Facilitator Does NOT Do**:
- Decide research questions alone
- Collect data without stakeholder involvement
- Interpret findings in isolation
- Control publication/dissemination

### Community Member Role → Co-Researcher
**Responsibilities**:
- Share lived experience expertise
- Co-design research methods
- Collect and analyze data
- Present findings to community

**Capacity Building Provided**:
- Research methods training (IRB, interviewing, coding)
- Critical analysis skills (power mapping, theory)
- Presentation skills (academic, community formats)

### Institutional Partners → Critical Friends
**Responsibilities**:
- Provide access (settings, participants)
- Remove barriers (bureaucratic, financial)
- Commit to action (implement findings)

**Boundary Setting**:
- Cannot veto findings
- Must share decision-making power
- Transparent about constraints
```

**PAR Methodology Example: Wage Theft Study**

```markdown
## Case: Restaurant Workers' PAR on Wage Theft

### Problem Identification (Co-Constructed)
**Traditional Framing**: "Low-wage workers don't report wage violations"
**PAR Reframing**: "What are the barriers restaurant workers face in claiming stolen wages, and how can we collectively overcome them?"

### Research Design (Participatory)
**Co-Researchers**: 8 restaurant workers (busser, server, cook roles)
**Academic Partners**: 2 labor studies researchers
**Community Partners**: 1 worker center organizer

**Training Phase** (Month 1-2):
- IRB ethics training (community-adapted)
- Interviewing skills workshop
- Power mapping exercise
- Participatory data analysis intro

**Data Collection** (Month 3-5):
- Worker-to-worker interviews (60 interviews)
  - Rationale: Peer interviews reduce power imbalance
  - Language: Spanish, Mandarin, English
- Policy document analysis (co-led by academic)
- Photovoice: Workplace conditions documentation

**Analysis Phase** (Month 6-7):
- Coding workshops: 6 sessions, 3 hours each
  - Academic teaches grounded theory basics
  - Workers identify themes from lived experience
  - Consensus on code definitions
- Pattern analysis: Connecting individual stories to systemic issues

### Findings (Co-Interpreted)
**Theme 1**: "Fear Ecology" (worker-coined term)
- Immigration status threats
- Retaliation (schedule cuts, termination)
- Blacklisting across restaurants

**Theme 2**: "Strategic Ignorance" (academic concept, worker examples)
- Employers withhold rights information
- Wage calculation opacity
- Multilingual workers excluded

### Action Outcomes
1. **Policy Change**: City council wage theft ordinance (worker testimony)
2. **Community Tool**: Know-Your-Rights pamphlet (8 languages, worker-designed)
3. **Organizing**: New worker committee (ongoing peer education)
4. **Academic Output**: Co-authored journal article (workers listed as authors)

### Power-Sharing Evidence
- Research budget controlled by worker majority vote
- Academic jargon translated/simplified in all meetings
- Workers decided publication venues (community report before journal)
- Stipends: $25/hour for all worker research time
```

#### 2.2 Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)

**Distinguishing Features**:
- **Focus**: Health equity, environmental justice, community development
- **Partnership Model**: Long-term university-community partnerships (5-10+ years)
- **Outcomes**: Policy change + community capacity + peer-reviewed research

**CBPR Principles** (Adapted from Israel et al., 2013):

1. **Recognize community as unit of identity**
   - Define "community" with stakeholders (geography, identity, issue-based)
   - Honor community's cultural norms and communication styles

2. **Build on community strengths and resources**
   - Asset mapping (not deficit-focused)
   - Local knowledge as expertise

3. **Facilitate collaborative, equitable partnerships**
   - Shared decision-making structures (steering committees)
   - Equitable distribution of resources (funding, authorship)

4. **Foster co-learning and capacity building**
   - Bidirectional skill transfer
   - Community members train academics on cultural competency

5. **Balance research and action for mutual benefit**
   - Immediate community benefit (not "future" promises)
   - Academic rigor maintained through participatory validity

6. **Focus on local relevance and social determinants**
   - Community-identified priorities drive research questions
   - Structural/systemic analysis (not individual blame)

7. **Involve cyclical and iterative processes**
   - CBPR as multi-year, multi-cycle commitment
   - Findings inform next research questions

8. **Disseminate results to all partners**
   - Community-friendly formats (videos, infographics, town halls)
   - Academic publications accessible (open access, plain language summaries)

9. **Commit to long-term process and sustainability**
   - Institutional commitment beyond single grant
   - Infrastructure for community ownership

**CBPR Governance Structure Example**:

```markdown
## CBPR Partnership: Youth Mental Health Initiative

### Steering Committee (Decision-Making Body)
**Composition** (15 members, meet monthly):
- Youth representatives: 5 (ages 16-24, stipend $50/meeting)
- Community organization staff: 3 (mental health center, school, youth org)
- University researchers: 3 (PI, Co-I, grad student)
- Parent/family representatives: 2
- Policy advocate: 1
- Mental health provider: 1

**Decision-Making Process**:
- Consensus-based (not voting)
- All major decisions require 80% agreement
- Dissent documented and addressed

**Decisions Requiring Steering Committee Approval**:
- Research questions and hypotheses
- Methodology and instruments
- Budget allocation (>$5,000 items)
- Data interpretation and framing
- Dissemination plans and authorship
- Staffing (hiring, roles)

### Subcommittees (Implementation)

**Data Collection Subcommittee**:
- Design survey and interview protocols
- Adapt measures for cultural relevance
- Train peer data collectors

**Community Action Subcommittee**:
- Translate findings into action plans
- Coordinate with schools/organizations
- Organize community events

**Dissemination Subcommittee**:
- Develop community report (youth-led graphic design)
- Prepare academic manuscripts (co-authorship)
- Plan community presentation events

### Power-Sharing Mechanisms

1. **Budget Co-Control**:
   - Community members have signing authority
   - 30% of budget for community-determined priorities
   - Transparent financial reporting (quarterly)

2. **Hiring Decisions**:
   - Community members on all search committees
   - Lived experience valued equally with credentials
   - Community veto power over hires

3. **Intellectual Property**:
   - Data co-owned by partnership (MOU)
   - Community approval required for publication
   - Community members as first authors (when leading analysis)

4. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - External mediator on retainer
   - Community members can call mediation
   - University cannot unilaterally end partnership
```

**CBPR Research Example: Environmental Justice**

```markdown
## Case: Toxic Exposure in Fenceline Community

### Partnership Formation (Year 1)
**Community Issue**: High asthma rates near oil refinery
**Community Partner**: Residents Association (30-year history)
**University Partner**: Environmental health department
**Funding**: EPA Environmental Justice grant ($500K, 3 years)

### Co-Learning Phase
**University teaches Community**:
- Air quality monitoring techniques
- Epidemiological study design
- Biostatistics basics

**Community teaches University**:
- History of environmental racism in region
- Cultural communication norms (door-to-door, not online surveys)
- Political landscape (which officials are allies)

### Research Design (Co-Created)
**Question** (evolved through 6 months of dialogue):
"How do pollution exposures from the refinery contribute to respiratory health disparities in our community, and what policy changes are needed?"

**Methods**:
1. **Participatory Air Monitoring**:
   - Residents trained to deploy sensors (n=50 homes)
   - 6-month continuous monitoring
   - Community members co-analyze spatial patterns

2. **Health Survey**:
   - Door-to-door (residents as interviewers)
   - Culturally adapted Spanish/English versions
   - Biomarker collection (spirometry, FeNO)

3. **Policy Analysis**:
   - Review refinery permits (community + academic co-analysis)
   - Identify loopholes enabling excess emissions

### Action Integration
**Concurrent with Research**:
- Community forum (Month 6): Preliminary air quality data shared
- Petition campaign (Month 9): 1,200 signatures for stricter permits
- Media advocacy (Month 12): Op-eds, press conference (residents as spokespeople)

**Post-Research**:
- Testimony at Air Quality Board (residents + PI)
- Policy win: Refinery required to reduce benzene emissions 40%
- Ongoing monitoring: Community-owned air sensors continue

### Capacity Building Outcomes
**Community Gains**:
- 10 residents certified as community air monitors
- Association now consults for other environmental justice groups
- Youth internship program (ongoing research training)

**University Gains**:
- New understanding of culturally responsive recruitment
- Community advisory board for all environmental health research
- 8 peer-reviewed publications (50% with community co-authors)
```

#### 2.3 Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR)

**Defining Features**:
- **Participants**: Youth (typically ages 13-24) as lead researchers
- **Settings**: Schools, community organizations, youth development programs
- **Focus**: Issues affecting young people (education equity, policing, mental health)
- **Outcomes**: Youth empowerment + social change + critical consciousness

**YPAR Theoretical Foundations**:
- **Critical Pedagogy** (Freire): Education as practice of freedom
- **Positive Youth Development**: Youth as assets, not problems
- **Youth Organizing**: Research as tool for activism

**Developmental Considerations**:

| Age Group | Cognitive Capacity | YPAR Adaptations |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Middle School (11-14)** | Concrete operational → Early formal operational | - Hands-on methods (photovoice, mapping)<br>- Shorter cycles (4-6 weeks)<br>- Scaffolded analysis (guided coding)<br>- Visual data presentation |
| **High School (14-18)** | Formal operational | - Complex research questions<br>- Longer cycles (semester-long)<br>- Independent data collection<br>- Quantitative analysis capable |
| **Young Adult (18-24)** | Formal operational + Life experience | - Policy-focused research<br>- Year-long projects<br>- Mixed methods<br>- Academic-community bridge roles |

**YPAR Cycle Structure** (School-Based Example):

```markdown
## YPAR Project: School Discipline Disparities

### Semester 1: Consciousness-Raising & Question Formation

**Week 1-3: Building Critical Consciousness**
- Activity: "Discipline Stories Circle"
  - Youth share personal experiences with school discipline
  - Facilitator highlights patterns (race, gender, disability)
  - Introduction to systemic analysis (not individual blame)

- Activity: "Data Deep Dive"
  - Youth examine school's suspension data (disaggregated)
  - Reactions: "Why are Black students suspended 3x more?"
  - Generate questions: "Is this happening because of bias?"

**Week 4-6: Research Question Design**
- Youth brainstorm research questions (50+ questions generated)
- Group into themes (teacher bias, zero tolerance policy, student voice)
- Prioritization activity (dot voting)
- Final question: "How do teachers' implicit biases and school policies contribute to racial disparities in suspensions at our school?"

**Week 7-8: Methods Training**
- Survey design workshop (Likert scales, open-ended questions)
- Interview skills roleplay (youth interview each other)
- Observation protocol practice (classroom observations)
- Ethics training (peer consent, confidentiality, power dynamics)

### Semester 2: Data Collection & Analysis

**Week 9-14: Data Collection**
- Student survey: 350 students (Grades 9-12)
  - Youth-designed questions on fairness perceptions
  - Distributed during lunch (youth as surveyors)

- Teacher interviews: 15 teachers (volunteer sample)
  - Youth-conducted interviews (pairs, 30 min each)
  - Questions about discipline philosophy, implicit bias awareness

- Observation: 40 classroom observations
  - Youth observe interactions (teacher-student)
  - Focus on disciplinary moments (redirections, referrals)

**Week 15-18: Data Analysis**
- Survey analysis workshop:
  - Input data into SPSS (youth learn basics)
  - Descriptive statistics (frequencies, cross-tabs)
  - Findings: Black students report lower fairness perceptions

- Interview coding:
  - Transcription (youth transcribe own interviews)
  - Coding workshop (open coding → axial coding)
  - Themes: "Colorblind ideology," "Culture clash," "Fear of students"

- Synthesis meeting:
  - Compare survey + interview + observation findings
  - Triangulation: Do patterns align?
  - Root cause analysis: Policy + Bias + Lack of Training

### Semester 3: Action & Dissemination

**Week 19-22: Action Planning**
- Youth develop recommendations:
  1. Mandatory implicit bias training (all teachers, annually)
  2. Restorative justice pilot program (replace suspensions)
  3. Student-teacher dialogue circles (monthly)
  4. Discipline data dashboard (public, updated quarterly)

**Week 23-25: Dissemination**
- Community presentation (parents, students, school board)
  - Youth create slideshow and video (student testimonials)
  - Q&A facilitated by youth

- School board testimony (3 youth researchers)
  - 5-minute presentation of findings
  - Request for policy changes

- Academic poster (regional youth research conference)
  - Youth co-design poster with adult facilitator
  - Present alongside university researchers

**Week 26: Reflection & Celebration**
- Reflection circle: "How has YPAR changed you?"
- Celebration event: Recognition of youth as researchers
- Next steps: Alumni support ongoing implementation

### Action Outcomes (Year 1 Post-Research)
- Policy: School board approves bias training mandate
- Practice: Restorative justice program starts (50 students)
- Youth: 8 YPAR participants join district's equity committee
- Research: Findings inform district-wide discipline review
```

**YPAR Facilitation Strategies**:

1. **Youth Voice Amplification**:
   - Adults as facilitators, not leaders
   - Youth majority in all decision-making votes
   - Create space for dissent/disagreement among youth

2. **Skill Scaffolding**:
   - "I do, we do, you do" model for research skills
   - Peer mentoring (older youth train younger)
   - Celebrate mistakes as learning

3. **Emotional Support**:
   - Research can trigger trauma (e.g., discipline stories)
   - Check-ins and mental health resources
   - Option to step back without penalty

4. **Power Analysis Integration**:
   - Name power dynamics in research team (adult-youth, teacher-student)
   - Discuss how research itself can reproduce power (who benefits?)
   - Critical questions: "Whose knowledge counts? Who gets published?"

**YPAR vs. Adult PAR Differences**:

| Dimension | YPAR | Adult PAR |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Timeline** | School year aligned (Sept-May) | Flexible, multi-year |
| **Methodology** | Visual, creative (art, video) | Traditional + creative |
| **Action Focus** | Immediate school/community change | Policy + systems change |
| **Facilitator Role** | High scaffolding, developmental | Peer facilitation |
| **Power Dynamics** | Adult-youth hierarchy explicit | Researcher-community hierarchy |
| **Dissemination** | Youth-accessible (TikTok, posters) | Academic + community |

### 3. Stakeholder Collaboration

#### 3.1 Power-Sharing Mechanisms

**Principle**: Action research must redistribute power from researchers to participants. This section provides concrete structures to operationalize democratic participation.

**Arnstein's Ladder of Participation** (Adapted for AR):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Degrees of Stakeholder Power         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  8. Stakeholder Control                     │ ← IDEAL AR
│     (Community owns research, hires experts)│
│                                             │
│  7. Delegated Power                         │ ← STRONG AR
│     (Stakeholders have majority in decisions)│
│                                             │

**Power-Sharing Mechanisms Toolkit**:

**Mechanism 1: Decision-Making Matrices**

```markdown
## Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Stakeholder Group | Research Team | Joint | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Research question | ✓ | | | Community defines problem |
| Methodology selection | | | ✓ | Requires technical + lived expertise |
| Budget allocation | ✓ | | | Community controls resources |
| Data collection tools | | | ✓ | Cultural adaptation + validity |
| Data interpretation | ✓ | | | Community meaning-making priority |
| Action planning | ✓ | | | Community implements, must own plan |
| Dissemination venues | | | ✓ | Balance community + academic impact |
| Authorship decisions | | | ✓ | Contribution-based (ICMJE criteria) |

**Dispute Resolution**:
- If disagreement on "Joint" decision: Mediation by neutral third party
- Researchers cannot override stakeholder authority
- Stakeholders can veto researcher proposals (with rationale)
```

**Mechanism 2: Rotating Facilitation**

```markdown
## Meeting Facilitation Schedule

### Principle
Power is enacted through who controls meeting agendas and airtime.
Rotating facilitation distributes this power.

### Structure (Monthly Meetings)
| Month | Facilitator | Note-Taker | Timekeeper | Agenda-Setter |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| Jan | Academic researcher | Community member A | Youth member | Community org staff |
| Feb | Community member B | Academic researcher | Community member C | Youth member |
| Mar | Youth member | Community org staff | Academic researcher | Community member A |
| [Continue rotation] | | | | |

### Facilitation Training
- All members receive 2-hour facilitation workshop (Month 1)
- Skills: Agenda design, managing conflict, ensuring equity of voice
- Facilitation guide provided (templates, scripts for common scenarios)

### Accountability
- Post-meeting evaluation (1-5 scale):
  - "Did everyone have chance to speak?"
  - "Were decisions made transparently?"
  - "Did facilitator manage power dynamics well?"
```

**Mechanism 3: Compensated Participation**

```markdown
## Compensation Policy

### Rationale
Unpaid participation privileges those with economic security.
Compensation signals that community expertise is valued equally to academic credentials.

### Compensation Structure

**Stipends for Participation**:
| Role | Activity | Rate | Rationale |
|------|----------|------|-----------|
| Co-researcher | Research team meetings (2 hrs) | $50 | Match academic hourly rate |
| Co-researcher | Data collection | $25/hour | Actual time + prep |
| Co-researcher | Analysis workshops (3 hrs) | $75 | Intensive cognitive work |
| Advisory board member | Quarterly meetings (2 hrs) | $100 | Expert consultation |
| Youth participant | YPAR sessions (after-school) | $20/hour | Above minimum wage |

**In-Kind Support**:
- Transportation: Rideshare credits or public transit passes
- Childcare: On-site childcare during meetings
- Food: Meals provided for meetings over 2 hours
- Technology: Laptops/tablets loaned for duration of project

**Budgeting Guideline**:
- Allocate 20-30% of total research budget to stakeholder compensation
- Include in grant proposals from outset (not "leftover" funds)

**Tax Considerations**:
- Stipends >$600/year require 1099 tax form (US context)
- Fiscal sponsor can manage payments if community org lacks infrastructure
```

**Mechanism 4: Shared Authorship Protocols**

```markdown
## Authorship & Intellectual Property Agreement

### Principle
Traditional academic authorship excludes community knowledge contributions.
This protocol expands authorship criteria.

### Authorship Criteria (Adapted from ICMJE)
A person qualifies as author if they made **substantial contributions** to ≥2 of:

1. **Conceptualization**:
   - Defining research question
   - Identifying community problem

2. **Methodology**:
   - Designing data collection methods
   - Adapting measures for cultural relevance

3. **Investigation**:
   - Collecting data (interviews, surveys, observations)
   - Recruiting participants

4. **Analysis**:
   - Coding and interpreting data
   - Identifying themes

5. **Writing**:
   - Drafting sections (intro, methods, results, discussion)
   - Reviewing and editing manuscript

6. **Community Action**:
   - Translating findings into action
   - Disseminating to community

**Traditional authorship excludes #6 → PAR authorship includes it.**

### Authorship Decision Process

**Step 1: Contribution Tracking** (Ongoing)
- Shared spreadsheet: All team members log contributions monthly
- Categories align with criteria above

**Step 2: Author Meeting** (When preparing publication)
- Review contribution logs
- Discuss who meets criteria (≥2 substantial contributions)
- Order authors by level of contribution (most → least)
  - Exception: Community members can choose order (e.g., alphabetical within community group)

**Step 3: Non-Author Acknowledgment**
- Those with <2 substantial contributions = Acknowledged (not authors)
- Acknowledgment section specifies contributions (e.g., "recruited participants")

### Special Considerations

**Community Members Preferring Not to Be Named**:
- Option: Acknowledge contribution without identifying (e.g., "community research team")
- Document consent for attribution

**Posthumous Authorship**:
- If community member passes during project: Family consulted on authorship inclusion

**Collective Authorship**:
- Option: "Community Research Team" as author (list members in footnote)
- Use when individual contributions hard to differentiate
```

#### 3.2 Democratic Inquiry Processes

**Core Principle**: All stakeholders have equal epistemic authority. Lived experience is expertise.

**Democratic Inquiry Structures**:

**Structure 1: Dialogue Circles** (Inspired by Indigenous talking circles)

```markdown
## Dialogue Circle Protocol

### Purpose
Create non-hierarchical space for collective knowledge construction.
Disrupt academic dominance in interpretation.

### Physical Setup
- Chairs in circle (no tables as barriers)
- Talking piece (stone, feather, or community-selected object)
- No recording devices unless all consent

### Facilitator Role
- Not the academic researcher (power dynamics)
- Trained in circle keeping (community elder, trained facilitator)
- Intervenes only to maintain safety, not to direct content

### Circle Process

**Opening (5-10 min)**:
- Land acknowledgment or community ritual
- Intention setting: "Why are we here?"
- Circle agreements (co-created, e.g., "confidentiality," "speak from I," "right to pass")

**Check-In Round (1-2 min per person)**:
- Prompt: "How are you arriving to this circle today?"
- Everyone speaks, no responses (active listening only)
- Builds presence and empathy

**Inquiry Rounds (Theme-Based)**:
- Prompt example: "What does this data mean for our community?"
- Pass talking piece clockwise
- Speaker has floor until they pass piece (no time limit)
- Others practice deep listening (no phones, side conversations)

**Synthesis Round (Optional)**:
- Prompt: "What patterns did you hear across our stories?"
- Facilitator does NOT synthesize (stakeholders do)

**Closing Round**:
- Prompt: "What are you taking from this circle?"
- Closing ritual (moment of silence, gratitude expression)

### Power-Sharing Elements
- Academic knowledge does not override community knowledge
- Silence is valued (not "filling air time")
- Dissent is welcomed (not consensus-forced)
- Emotional expression valid (not just "rational" discourse)

### When to Use Dialogue Circles
- Interpreting sensitive data (e.g., trauma narratives)
- Conflict resolution within research team
- Decision-making on controversial topics
- Reflection after action phase
```

**Structure 2: Participatory Data Analysis Workshops**

```markdown
## Co-Analysis Workshop Design

### Challenge
Traditional qualitative analysis (researcher alone coding in NVivo) excludes stakeholder meaning-making.

### Solution
Structured workshops where stakeholders co-analyze data.

### Workshop Structure (3-Hour Session)

**Pre-Workshop** (Academic Researcher Preparation):
- Select 10-15 representative data excerpts (quotes, photos, field notes)
- Print on large cards (8.5x11 inches, one excerpt per card)
- Prepare analysis materials (markers, post-its, chart paper)

**Workshop Agenda**:

**Part 1: Familiarization (30 min)**
- Spread data cards on large table
- Participants walk around, read silently (gallery walk)
- Initial reactions: "What stands out to you?"

**Part 2: Open Coding (45 min)**
- Small groups (3-4 people, mix academics + community)
- Each group gets 5 data cards
- Task: "What is this data about? Label it with a phrase."
- Write labels on post-its, stick to cards
- No pre-set codes (codes emerge from data + stakeholder knowledge)

**Part 3: Theme Development (45 min)**
- Bring all groups together
- Sort cards into piles by similarity
- Name each pile (these become themes)
- Discuss: "Why do these go together? What's the deeper meaning?"

**Part 4: Theory Building (45 min)**
- Map relationships between themes (draw on chart paper)
- Connect to stakeholder knowledge: "Does this match your experience?"
- Connect to theory (academic introduces relevant concepts, stakeholders decide if it fits)

**Part 5: Action Implications (15 min)**
- "So what?" discussion
- "What do these findings mean for action?"
- Document action ideas

### Validity in Co-Analysis
- **Participatory Validity**: Findings are valid if they resonate with stakeholder lived experience
- **Catalytic Validity**: Research is valid if it prompts action and transformation
- Not sacrificing rigor—expanding what counts as rigorous

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Power Imbalance**
- Academic knowledge seems more "legitimate"
- **Solution**: Facilitator explicitly validates community knowledge ("That's an important insight from your experience")

**Challenge 2: Jargon**
- Academics use technical terms
- **Solution**: "Jargon jar" (quarter for each unexplained term, funds go to community org)

**Challenge 3: Time**
- Community members have work/family obligations
- **Solution**: Compensate time, provide childcare, offer virtual option

**Challenge 4: Conflict in Interpretation**
- Stakeholders disagree on what data means
- **Solution**: Document multiple interpretations (not forced consensus)
```

**Structure 3: Transparent Decision-Making Records**

```markdown
## Decision Log Template

### Purpose
Make research decisions visible and accountable.
Prevent "researcher decides behind closed doors" pattern.

### Log Entry Format

**Decision ID**: [D-001]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Decision Type**: [Research Question / Methodology / Budget / Authorship / Action Plan]

**Decision Statement**:
[Clear, one-sentence description of what was decided]

**Who Participated in Decision**:
- [Name, Role] - Present
- [Name, Role] - Absent (consulted via email)

**Decision-Making Process**:
- [Consensus / Voting / Delegated Authority]
- Vote breakdown (if applicable): [5 For, 1 Against, 2 Abstain]

**Rationale**:
[Why this decision was made, key factors considered]

**Dissenting Views**:
[If not consensus, document minority perspectives]
Example: "Two members felt we should prioritize interviews over surveys due to literacy concerns. Majority view prioritized larger sample size for quantitative credibility with policymakers."

**Next Steps / Accountability**:
- [Action Item 1] - Responsible: [Name] - Deadline: [Date]
- [Action Item 2] - Responsible: [Name] - Deadline: [Date]

**Review Date**:
[When will we revisit this decision if needed?]

---

### Example Decision Log Entry

**Decision ID**: D-012
**Date**: 2024-11-03
**Decision Type**: Methodology

**Decision Statement**:
We will use photovoice as primary data collection method for Phase 2, supplemented by interviews.

**Who Participated**:
- Maria Gonzalez, Community Co-Researcher - Present
- Dr. Jane Smith, University PI - Present
- 5 youth co-researchers - Present (via Zoom)
- Roberto Martinez, Community Org Director - Absent (emailed input)

**Decision-Making Process**:
Consensus after 45-minute discussion

**Rationale**:
Youth co-researchers advocated strongly for photovoice, citing:
1. More accessible than written surveys for multilingual community
2. Creates visual data for community presentations (more engaging)
3. Empowering (youth control narrative through photos)

Academic researcher initially hesitant (validity concerns), but convinced by:
1. Literature on photovoice rigor (Wang & Burris, 1997)
2. Youth point that visual data captures context that interviews miss

**Dissenting Views**:
None (consensus reached)

**Next Steps**:
- Develop photovoice protocol: Youth subgroup + Dr. Smith - Due: Nov 17
- Camera/phone acquisition (budget $800): Maria - Due: Nov 10
- IRB amendment for photo consent: Dr. Smith - Due: Nov 15

**Review Date**:
After 10 youth complete photovoice (approx. Dec 15) - assess if method working as intended
```

#### 3.3 Co-Researcher Relationships

**Redefining Roles**:

Traditional academic research creates hierarchical roles:
- **Principal Investigator** → Decision-maker, expert
- **Research Participants** → Data sources, passive

Action research flattens hierarchy:
- **Academic Facilitator** → Shares research expertise, learns from community
- **Community Co-Researchers** → Share lived expertise, learn research skills
- **Institutional Partners** → Provide access, commit to action

**Co-Researcher Relationship Building**:

```markdown
## Relationship-Building Timeline

### Phase 1: Pre-Partnership (3-6 Months Before Formal Research)

**Activities**:
- Academic attends community events (not leading, just present)
- Informal conversations about community priorities (not research agenda)
- Provide support with no strings attached (e.g., help with grant, volunteer)

**Goal**: Build trust before asking for anything

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- "I want to study your community" (extractive framing)
- Showing up only when you need something
- Making promises you can't keep

### Phase 2: Co-Visioning (2-3 Months)

**Activity 1: Community Visioning Workshop**
- Prompt: "What does our community need to thrive?"
- Method: World Café, appreciative inquiry, or photovoice
- Output: Community-generated priorities (research emerges from these, not imposed)

**Activity 2: Research Relationship Discussion**
- Transparent conversation: "What has been your experience with researchers in the past?"
- Common answers: "They take our data and disappear," "Nothing changes"
- Discuss: "How can this partnership be different? What would make it trustworthy?"

**Activity 3: Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**
- Formal agreement on:
  - Shared ownership of data
  - Decision-making processes
  - Compensation and resources
  - Publication and dissemination
  - Conflict resolution
  - Exit strategy (how partnership ends, if needed)

### Phase 3: Co-Learning (Ongoing Throughout Project)

**Bidirectional Skill Transfer**:

**Academic Teaches Community**:
- Research methods (interviewing, survey design, coding)
- Data analysis (statistics, thematic analysis)
- Academic writing and publication process

**Community Teaches Academic**:
- Cultural protocols and communication norms
- Historical context of community issues
- Power dynamics and politics
- Effective action strategies

**Co-Learning Activities**:
- Joint reading groups (academic articles + community knowledge)
- Skill-sharing workshops (e.g., community member teaches organizing tactics)
- Reflective dialogue: "What are we each learning from this partnership?"

### Phase 4: Sustaining Relationships (Post-Research)

**Challenge**: Research projects end, but relationships should continue.

**Sustainability Strategies**:
- Alumni network: Former co-researchers meet quarterly
- Ongoing support: Academic provides letters of support, consultation
- New projects: Community initiates next research (academic supports)
- Infrastructure: Community-controlled research center/lab (academic affiliated)

**Example: Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center**:
- 25+ year partnership (since 1995)
- Community board governs research center
- Trains new cohorts of community researchers annually
- Produced 100+ peer-reviewed publications, numerous policy changes
- Model: Long-term infrastructure, not one-off projects
```

**Navigating Power Dynamics in Co-Researcher Relationships**:

```markdown
## Power Dynamics Analysis Tool

### Exercise: Power Mapping (Do with Full Research Team)

**Step 1: Identify Power Dimensions**
List all forms of power present in partnership:

| Power Type | Who Has It | How It Shows Up |
|------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Academic Credentials** | University researcher | Called "Dr.", deference to expertise |
| **Funding Control** | University (grant holder) | Can decide budget allocations |
| **Lived Experience** | Community members | Know context, history, culture |
| **Organizational Access** | Community org staff | Can open doors to participants |
| **Time Flexibility** | Varies | Who can attend meetings? (9-5 vs. evenings) |
| **Language** | Varies | Whose language dominates meetings? (academic jargon vs. community vernacular) |
| **Institutional Authority** | University | IRB, publication venues controlled by academy |
| **Social Networks** | Community members | Know who to talk to, trusted relationships |

**Step 2: Discuss Power Imbalances**
- Where is power concentrated? (Usually academic side)
- How does this affect decisions? (Whose ideas get taken seriously?)
- What are consequences? (Community members might self-silence)

**Step 3: Strategies to Redistribute Power**
For each imbalance, identify counter-strategy:

| Imbalance | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Academic has "Dr." title | Community members called "Dr." in their expertise (e.g., "Dr. Maria, our expert in neighborhood history") |
| Funding controlled by university | Community co-PIs with signing authority, or fiscal sponsorship through community org |
| Meetings use academic jargon | Jargon jar, plain language commitment, community members interrupt to request translation |
| Academic writes publications | Community members lead writing, academic edits/mentors |
| University IRB as gatekeeper | Community-based review board co-reviews protocols |

**Step 4: Ongoing Power Audits**
- Quarterly check-in: "How are power dynamics shifting? Where are we still stuck?"
- Metrics: Who talks most in meetings? Whose ideas get implemented? Who authors publications?
```

### 4. Change Documentation

**Purpose**: Action research must document both the CHANGE PROCESS and the OUTCOMES. Traditional research documents outcomes only.

#### 4.1 Action Logs

**What to Document**:
- What was planned vs. what actually happened (implementation fidelity)
- In-the-moment adjustments and why they were made
- Stakeholder reactions and participation
- Contextual factors influencing implementation
- Researcher reflexivity (how did my presence shape what happened?)

**Action Log Template (Daily/Weekly)**:

```markdown
## Action Log Entry

**Cycle**: [Cycle number, e.g., Cycle 2]
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Time**: [HH:MM - HH:MM]
**Logger**: [Name of person documenting]
**Location**: [Where action occurred]

### Planned Action (from Action Plan)
**Action ID**: [A-C2-003]
**Description**: [What was supposed to happen today]
**Intended Participants**: [Who was supposed to be involved]
**Expected Outcome**: [What we thought would result]

### Actual Implementation

**What Happened** (Narrative):
[Detailed description of what occurred, step-by-step]

Example:
"We planned to facilitate a dialogue circle with 12 community members to discuss preliminary findings. Only 7 showed up—we later learned there was a conflicting community event (church service). We proceeded with the 7 present. The circle began with check-in round, but participant Maria shared a story about her son's arrest that shifted the entire conversation. Instead of discussing our data, the circle became a healing space where participants shared trauma stories related to policing. As facilitators, we made a decision to honor this emergent need rather than redirecting to our agenda."

**Deviations from Plan**:
| Aspect | Planned | Actual | Reason for Deviation |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Attendance | 12 people | 7 people | Scheduling conflict (church event) |
| Agenda | Data discussion | Healing circle | Participant-initiated shift, group consensus to follow |
| Facilitator role | Guide discussion | Hold space for emotions | Responding to emergent needs |

**In-the-Moment Decisions**:
1. **Decision**: Abandon planned agenda, let conversation flow
   - **Rationale**: Participant need for healing space more urgent than our research timeline
   - **Who decided**: Co-facilitators (academic + community) consulted silently via note-passing, agreed
   - **Consequences**: Positive (deepened trust), Negative (didn't get planned data discussion)

**Stakeholder Participation**:
| Participant (Pseudonym) | Role | Level of Engagement | Notable Contributions |
|-------------------------|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Maria | Community member | High | Initiated vulnerable sharing, others followed her lead |
| James | Community member | Medium | Affirmed others' stories, provided policy context |
| Dr. Lin | Academic facilitator | Low (by design) | Held space, did not dominate |

### Observations

**Participant Reactions** (Quotes, Behaviors):
- Maria (tearful): "I've never had space to tell this story. Thank you for hearing me."
- James: Nodded vigorously during others' stories, showed solidarity
- Three participants stayed 30 minutes after official end time (continued conversation)

**Contextual Factors**:
- **Facilitating**: Safe space established (circle format), tissues available, trauma-informed facilitators
- **Hindering**: Room was cold (custodian turned off heat), some discomfort
- **Unexpected**: Participant brought her daughter (age 12)—daughter listened quietly, later thanked us

**Researcher Reflexivity**:
[How did my identity, assumptions, actions shape what happened?]

Example:
"As the academic facilitator, I initially felt anxious when the conversation diverged from our plan. I caught myself wanting to redirect. This reflects my academic socialization (stay on topic, efficiency). But my community co-facilitator, James, whispered 'This is the work'—reminding me that relationship-building and healing are the foundation for action. I'm learning to loosen my grip on agendas and trust the process."

### Emergent Insights

**What We're Learning**:
- Community members need healing spaces BEFORE they can engage in analytical research discussions
- Our timeline (researcher-driven) may not align with community readiness
- Trauma-informed practice requires flexibility in research protocols

**Questions Raised**:
- Should we add a healing circle phase to our AR cycle before data discussion phases?
- How do we balance participant need for catharsis with research objectives?
- What is our ethical responsibility when research triggers trauma?

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**:
- [ ] Debrief with co-facilitator (scheduled for tomorrow)
- [ ] Follow up with Maria (check-in on emotional well-being)
- [ ] Revise next meeting agenda to include healing space component

**Adjustments to Action Plan**:
- Add "Healing Circle" as Phase 0 in future cycles
- Budget for trauma counselor on-call during sensitive discussions
- Reschedule data discussion meeting for two weeks out (when community ready)

#### 4.2 Reflection Journals

**Dual Purpose**:
1. **Researcher Reflexivity**: Examining one's positionality, biases, emotional reactions
2. **Co-Researcher Development**: Tracking learning and growth over time

**Reflection Journal Prompts** (Weekly):

```markdown
## Reflection Journal - Week [N]

### For All Team Members (Researchers + Co-Researchers)

**Prompt 1: Action Reflection**
"This week, our action research team [describe activity]. My role was [describe]. As I reflect on this experience..."

- What surprised me?
- What challenged my assumptions?
- What am I proud of?
- What do I wish had gone differently?

**Prompt 2: Positionality Check**
"My identity (race, class, gender, education, etc.) shaped this week's work in these ways..."

- Where did my privilege show up?
- Where did I experience marginalization?
- How did power dynamics play out in our team interactions?

**Prompt 3: Learning & Growth**
"I learned [new skill/insight] this week. I'm applying it by..."

- Research skill gained:
- Community knowledge gained:
- Personal growth area:

**Prompt 4: Relationship Reflection**
"My relationship with [team member / community partner] evolved this week..."

- What is building trust?
- Where is there tension?

- Whose knowledge was privileged in our discussions?
- When did I defer to community expertise? When did I assert academic expertise?
- How am I navigating this balance?

**Prompt 6: Ethics & Power**
"I noticed these ethical tensions or power imbalances this week..."

- Describe the situation:
- How did I respond in the moment?
- What would I do differently?
- Do I need to raise this with the team?

### For Community Co-Researchers (Additional Prompts)

**Prompt 7: Voice & Agency**
"This week, I felt my voice was [heard/silenced/valued/dismissed] when..."

- Describe the situation:
- How did it feel?
- What would help me feel more empowered?
- What do I want to say to the team?

**Prompt 8: Research Identity**
"I'm starting to see myself as a researcher when..."

- What research skills am I developing?
- How is this changing how I see my community's issues?
- What kind of researcher do I want to become?

### Sample Reflection Journal Entry

**Date**: 2024-11-10
**Reflector**: Dr. Sarah Chen, University Co-Facilitator

**Prompt 1: Action Reflection**
This week, our team conducted 10 interviews with formerly incarcerated community members. My role was to co-train community interviewers and debrief after interviews. As I reflect on this experience:

- **Surprised me**: Community interviewers asked questions I would never have thought to ask. Example: One interviewer asked, "What did your kids say when you came home?" This opened up a whole thread about family reunification that I had missed in my literature review.

- **Challenged assumptions**: I assumed community interviewers would need a lot of hand-holding. They were naturals—their relationships and cultural knowledge made them better interviewers than I ever could be. I need to stop underestimating.

- **Proud of**: Creating space for interviewers to debrief. One interviewer, Marcus, got emotional hearing a participant's story that mirrored his own. We processed together, and he said it was healing.

- **Wish had gone differently**: I used jargon in the training ("semi-structured protocol")—saw confused faces. Need to check my academic language.

**Prompt 2: Positionality Check**
My identity as Chinese American, middle-class, never-incarcerated shaped this week:

- **Privilege showed up**: I can't fully understand the trauma of incarceration. When Marcus cried during debrief, I worried I was too clinical. My class privilege = emotional distance from this issue.

- **Power dynamics**: I'm still "Dr. Chen" while community interviewers are first names. This reinforces hierarchy. I asked the team to call me Sarah—mixed reactions. Need to revisit this.

**Prompt 6: Ethics & Power**
Ethical tension: One participant disclosed he was currently on parole and admitted to a parole violation during interview. Our IRB says we have mandatory reporting for "ongoing crimes." But reporting would betray trust and harm participant.

- **How I responded**: Consulted with community co-facilitator immediately after interview. We agreed NOT to report (parole violation is administrative, not violent crime). We prioritized participant safety over IRB rule.

- **What I'd do differently**: Should have anticipated this scenario and built community-driven ethics protocol BEFORE starting interviews. We're doing this now.

- **Raising with team**: Yes, agenda item for next meeting—revise consent form to clarify our commitment to participant safety over institutional rules.
```

#### 4.3 Progress Tracking

**Multi-Level Tracking**:
1. **Action Implementation Progress**: Are we doing what we planned?
2. **Outcome Progress**: Is change happening?
3. **Process Progress**: Are relationships deepening? Is power shifting?

**Integrated Progress Dashboard**:

```markdown
## AR Project Dashboard - [Month/Year]

| Outcome | Baseline | Target | Current | Trend | Data Source |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| # of community members trained as peer educators | 0 | 10 | 7 | ↗ Improving | Training attendance logs |
| # of youth participating in advocacy | 5 | 20 | 18 | ↗ Improving | Event sign-in sheets |
| Policy awareness (% aware of issue) | 25% (pre-survey) | 60% | 52% (mid-cycle survey) | ↗ Improving | Community surveys (n=100) |

**Long-Term Outcomes** (Transformative change—measured across cycles):
| Outcome | Baseline (Cycle 1) | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 (Current) | Target (End of Project) | Trend |
|---------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Policy change (ordinance passed) | No | No | In committee review | Yes | ↗ Progressing |
| Community organizing capacity (# of leaders) | 3 | 8 | 12 | 15 | ↗ Improving |
| Trust between community & institutions (scale 1-10) | 3.2 | 4.5 | 5.8 | 7.0 | ↗ Improving |

### Process Progress (Relationship & Power Dynamics)

**Participation Equity**:
| Indicator | Cycle 1 | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Goal | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|------|--------|
| % of meeting time community members speak | 30% | 45% | 60% | 50%+ | ✅ Met |
| # of decisions made by consensus | 5 of 12 (42%) | 8 of 10 (80%) | 9 of 10 (90%) | 80%+ | ✅ Met |
| Community members in leadership roles | 2 | 5 | 7 | 5+ | ✅ Met |
| Academic jargon incidents per meeting | 15 | 8 | 3 | <5 | ✅ Met |

**Trust & Relationship Indicators** (Qualitative):
- **Cycle 1**: Formal, polite interactions. Community members deferred to academic.
- **Cycle 2**: Increased comfort challenging academic ideas. First conflict resolved productively.
- **Cycle 3**: Deep trust evident. Community members proactively leading projects. Laughter and joking in meetings (sign of ease).

**Power Shifts Observed**:
- Community members now set meeting agendas (started Cycle 3)
- Academic researcher asked permission to add item to agenda (power reversal)
- Conflict over data interpretation resolved in favor of community interpretation

### Learning & Adaptation

**Key Learnings This Cycle**:
1. Community members need more time for data analysis than we budgeted—adjust future timelines
2. Policy change process slower than expected—need policy expert on team
3. Youth engagement highest when they co-design activities (not adult-led)

**Adaptations Made**:
| Original Plan | Adaptation | Rationale |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| 2-week data analysis phase | Extended to 5 weeks | Community co-analysts requested more time; quality over speed |
| Adult-led workshops | Youth co-facilitation model | Youth attendance dropped when adults led; co-facilitation boosted participation 40% |
| Monthly steering committee meetings | Bi-weekly check-ins added | Faster decision-making needed; monthly too slow |

### Risks & Mitigation

**Current Risks**:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Policy campaign stalls (political opposition) | Medium | High | Build coalition with allied council members; prepare plan B (administrative rule change) |
| Researcher burnout (community co-researchers juggling work + research) | Medium | Medium | Increase stipends; offer flexible participation options; check-ins on well-being |
| Institutional resistance (university bureaucracy slowing IRB amendments) | High | Low | Pre-emptive meeting with IRB chair; community advocates attend |

### Next Cycle Planning

**Cycle 4 Focus** (Based on Cycle 3 Reflection):
- Action: Launch policy campaign with 3 community forums
- Outcome Target: City council vote on ordinance
- Process Goal: Community members testify at council (without academic leading)
- Timeline: 12 weeks (Jan-Mar 2025)

## Examples

### Example 1: YPAR on School Discipline

**User Query**: "I'm working with high school students to investigate racial disparities in school suspensions using action research. How do I structure this as a YPAR project?"

**H2 Response**:
```markdown
## YPAR Project Design: School Discipline Disparities

I'll guide you through a Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) design following the Kemmis & McTaggart cycle, adapted for high school students (ages 14-18).

### Project Structure: Semester-Long YPAR (16 Weeks)

**Weeks 1-4: PLAN Phase (Consciousness-Raising)**
*Goal: Build critical consciousness about discipline disparities*

Activities:
1. "Discipline Stories Circle" (Week 1)
   - Youth share personal experiences with school discipline
   - Facilitator highlights patterns without leading (race, gender, disability)
   - Introduction to systemic analysis (not individual blame)

2. "Data Deep Dive" (Week 2)
   - Examine school's suspension data (disaggregated by race, gender, disability)
   - Youth reactions guide research question formation

3. Research Question Design Workshop (Week 3-4)
   - Brainstorm questions (expect 30-50 questions from youth)
   - Prioritize using dot voting
   - Example final question: "How do teachers' implicit biases and zero tolerance policies contribute to racial disparities in suspensions?"

**Weeks 5-8: ACT Phase (Data Collection)**
*Goal: Youth collect data as co-researchers*

Methods Training (Week 5):
- Survey design: Youth create student perception survey
- Interview skills: Roleplay teacher interviews
- Observation: Develop classroom observation protocol
- Ethics: Peer consent, confidentiality, power dynamics

Data Collection (Weeks 6-8):
- Student survey (n=300, administered by youth during lunch)
- Teacher interviews (n=15, youth in pairs conduct 30-min interviews)
- Classroom observations (n=40, youth observe discipline moments)

**Weeks 9-12: OBSERVE Phase (Analysis)**
*Goal: Youth interpret data using participatory analysis*

Co-Analysis Workshops:
- Survey analysis (Week 9): Youth input data, run descriptives in SPSS
  - Finding: Black students report lower fairness perceptions (Mean=2.1/5 vs. 3.8/5 for white students)

- Interview coding (Weeks 10-11): Youth transcribe and code transcripts
  - Themes: "Colorblind ideology," "Culture clash," "Fear of students"

- Synthesis (Week 12): Triangulation of survey + interview + observation
  - Root causes identified: Policy (zero tolerance) + Bias (implicit) + Training gap

**Weeks 13-16: REFLECT Phase (Action & Dissemination)**
*Goal: Use findings to advocate for change*

Action Planning (Week 13):
Youth develop 4 recommendations:
1. Mandatory implicit bias training (all teachers, annually)
2. Restorative justice pilot (replace suspensions for non-violent offenses)
3. Student-teacher dialogue circles (monthly)
4. Public discipline data dashboard (updated quarterly)

Dissemination (Weeks 14-15):
- Community presentation: Parents, students, school board (Youth create video + slides)
- School board testimony: 3 youth researchers present findings (5-min presentation)
- Academic poster: Regional youth research conference

Reflection & Celebration (Week 16):
- Reflection circle: "How has YPAR changed you?"
- Recognition event: Certificates for youth researchers
- Planning: Alumni join district equity committee

### Power-Sharing Mechanisms

1. **Youth Majority Decision-Making**:
   - All research decisions require 60% youth approval
   - Adults facilitate but do not override youth choices

2. **Compensated Participation**:
   - Youth researchers: $20/hour for after-school sessions (16 weeks × 3 hrs = $960 per youth)
   - Total budget for 10 youth: $9,600

3. **Rotating Facilitation**:
   - Week 1-4: Adult facilitates (modeling)
   - Week 5-8: Co-facilitation (adult + youth)
   - Week 9-16: Youth-led with adult support

4. **Emotional Support**:
   - Discipline stories can trigger trauma
   - School counselor on call during sessions
   - Youth can opt out of any activity

### Developmental Adaptations (High School Level)

| YPAR Element | Adult PAR Version | Youth Adaptation |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Research question** | Complex, multi-part | Single, focused question |
| **Methods** | Mixed methods (quant + qual) | Simplified quant (descriptives only) + qual (interviews, obs) |
| **Analysis** | Independent coding | Guided coding with templates |
| **Timeline** | 1-3 years | Semester (16 weeks) |
| **Dissemination** | Peer-reviewed journals | Youth-accessible (posters, videos, testimony) |

### Expected Outcomes

**Youth Development**:
- Critical consciousness (recognize systemic racism, not individual failings)
- Research skills (survey design, interviewing, data analysis)
- Civic engagement (testify at school board, join equity committee)
- Academic identity ("I'm a researcher now")

**School Change**:
- Policy: Implicit bias training adopted (likely outcome given strong data)
- Practice: Restorative justice pilot (may take 1-2 years to implement)
- Culture: Student voice valued in discipline policy (long-term shift)

**Researcher Learning** (You):
- Youth expertise on school culture (they see what adults miss)
- Authentic engagement requires ceding control (trust youth leadership)
- Change is slow (policy wins may come after project ends)

### 🛑 Human Checkpoint: CP_ACTION_PLAN

Does this YPAR structure align with your school context and youth group?

**Questions for you**:
1. Do you have 16 weeks (semester-long) or need shorter timeline?
2. Are youth volunteers or recruited? (Recruitment strategy differs)
3. Do you have IRB approval for youth as data collectors? (May need amended protocol)
4. School admin support? (Without it, access to data/teachers may be blocked)

Please confirm before I develop detailed lesson plans for each week.
```

### Example 2: CBPR for Health Equity

**User Query**: "I'm partnering with a community health center to address diabetes disparities using CBPR. What governance structure should we use?"

**H2 Response**:
```markdown
## CBPR Partnership Governance: Diabetes Disparities Project

Based on CBPR principles (Israel et al., 2013), I'll design a partnership governance structure that ensures community power-sharing and long-term sustainability.

### Proposed Governance Model: Steering Committee + Subcommittees

**Why This Model**:
- **Steering Committee**: Ensures strategic oversight with community majority
- **Subcommittees**: Distributes work while maintaining accountability to Steering Committee
- **Community majority**: Prevents academic/institutional takeover

### Steering Committee Structure

**Composition** (15 members total):
| Stakeholder Group | # of Seats | Selection Process |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Community members with diabetes** | 5 | Nominated by community health center patients, elected by peers |
| **Community health center staff** | 2 | Appointed by center director (1 provider, 1 community health worker) |
| **University researchers** | 3 | You (PI) + 2 Co-Investigators |
| **Family members/caregivers** | 2 | Nominated by community members |
| **Public health department** | 1 | Appointed by department (policy partner) |
| **Community organization** | 1 | Faith-based or cultural org serving affected community |
| **Community health advocate** | 1 | Independent, not affiliated with health center or university |

**Community Majority**: 9 of 15 seats (60%) held by community members (not academics or institutional staff)

**Meeting Schedule**:
- Monthly meetings (2 hours)
- Location: Alternates between health center and community site (not university)
- Time: Evening or weekend (accommodate work schedules)
- Meals provided + childcare on-site + transportation stipends

**Decision-Making Process**:
- **Consensus-based** (not voting): Aim for 80% agreement
- **Dissent documented**: Minority views recorded in meeting minutes
- **Major decisions requiring Steering Committee approval**:
  - Research questions and hypotheses
  - Methodology and data collection tools
  - Budget allocations >$5,000
  - Data interpretation and framing of findings
  - Dissemination plans and venues
  - Hiring research staff

**Compensation**:
- Steering Committee members: $100 per meeting (2 hours = $50/hr)
- Total annual cost: $18,000 (15 members × 12 meetings × $100)
- Rationale: Matches academic consultation rate, signals value of community expertise

### Subcommittees (Implementation Arms)

**1. Research Design Subcommittee** (Active during Year 1)
- **Members**: 2 community members, 2 researchers, 1 health center staff
- **Charge**:
  - Co-design survey and interview protocols
  - Adapt diabetes assessment tools for cultural relevance (language, health literacy)
  - Develop community-based recruitment strategy
- **Deliverables**:
  - Culturally adapted diabetes knowledge survey
  - Interview guide (English + [community language])
  - Recruitment plan (where, when, who recruits)

**2. Data Collection Subcommittee** (Active during Year 2)
- **Members**: 3 community members, 1 researcher, 1 community health worker
- **Charge**:
  - Train community members as peer data collectors
  - Implement recruitment plan
  - Conduct interviews and surveys
  - Monitor data quality
- **Deliverables**:
  - 10 community members trained and certified as data collectors
  - 200 surveys completed, 40 interviews conducted
  - Data quality report

**3. Community Action Subcommittee** (Active throughout, intensifies Year 3)
- **Members**: 4 community members, 1 health center staff, 1 public health rep
- **Charge**:
  - Translate research findings into action plans
  - Coordinate with health center and community organizations
  - Organize community events (health fairs, education workshops)
  - Advocate for policy changes (e.g., healthier food access)
- **Deliverables**:
  - Diabetes education program (culturally tailored)
  - Healthy food initiative (community gardens, grocery store partnership)
  - Policy brief for city council (e.g., soda tax, walkable neighborhoods)

**4. Dissemination Subcommittee** (Active Year 3-4)
- **Members**: 2 community members, 2 researchers, 1 community health worker
- **Charge**:
  - Develop community-friendly report (infographic, video)
  - Prepare academic manuscripts (co-authored)
  - Plan community presentation events
  - Manage media outreach
- **Deliverables**:
  - Community report (8-page, visual, translated)
  - 2-3 peer-reviewed publications (community co-authors)
  - Community presentation (town hall, health center event)
  - Media kit (press release, fact sheet)

### Power-Sharing Mechanisms

**1. Budget Co-Control**:
- **Community signing authority**: 2 community Steering Committee members added to university grant account as authorized signers
- **Budget oversight**: Quarterly financial reports reviewed by Steering Committee
- **Flexible allocation**: 30% of budget ($150,000 of $500,000 total) reserved for community-determined priorities
  - Example: Community decides to use funds for community health worker stipends, not originally in grant budget

**2. Hiring Decisions**:
- **Community veto power**: All research staff hires must be approved by Steering Committee (community majority)
- **Lived experience valued**: Job descriptions include "lived experience with diabetes" as qualification
- **Community on search committees**: 50% of search committee = community members

**3. Data Ownership**:
- **Co-ownership**: Data jointly owned by university and community health center (MOU signed)
- **Community approval required**: No publication without Steering Committee approval (prevent extractive research)
- **Data access**: Community health center gets copy of dataset (de-identified) for their own use

**4. Intellectual Property & Authorship**:
- **Community co-authors**: ICMJE criteria adapted to include community knowledge contributions (see authorship protocol below)
- **Community-first dissemination**: Community report published BEFORE academic journal articles (6-month gap)
- **Tools co-owned**: Diabetes education curriculum jointly owned (not university proprietary)

**5. Conflict Resolution**:
- **External mediator**: Retained on contract ($5,000 budget line)
- **Community can call mediation**: Any Steering Committee member can invoke mediation
- **University cannot unilaterally exit**: Partnership agreement requires 1-year notice + transition plan to community ownership

### Authorship Protocol (ICMJE Adapted for CBPR)

**Qualifies as Author if ≥2 Substantial Contributions to**:

| Contribution Area | Examples |
|-------------------|----------|
| 1. Conceptualization | Defining research question, identifying community problem |
| 2. Methodology | Designing data collection, adapting measures culturally |
| 3. Investigation | Recruiting participants, collecting data (surveys, interviews) |
| 4. Data Analysis | Coding transcripts, interpreting findings |
| 5. Writing | Drafting manuscript sections, reviewing/editing |
| **6. Community Action** | **Translating findings into action, disseminating to community** |

**Note**: Traditional ICMJE excludes #6 → CBPR includes it as legitimate scholarly contribution.

**Process**:
- Track contributions monthly in shared spreadsheet
- Author meeting before each publication: Review contributions, determine order
- Community members choose order among themselves (can be alphabetical if preferred)

### Timeline & Sustainability

**Year 1: Partnership Formation & Planning**
- Months 1-3: Steering Committee formation, MOU signing, governance training
- Months 4-6: Research Design Subcommittee: Co-design methods
- Months 7-9: IRB submission (community-approved protocol)
- Months 10-12: Pilot testing, revisions

**Year 2: Data Collection & Analysis**
- Months 13-18: Data collection (surveys, interviews)
- Months 19-24: Participatory data analysis workshops

**Year 3: Action & Dissemination**
- Months 25-30: Community action implementation (education program, policy advocacy)
- Months 31-36: Dissemination (community report, academic publications, presentations)

**Year 4-5: Sustainability & Scale-Up**
- Community health center institutionalizes diabetes program (no longer grant-funded)
- Steering Committee continues as Community Advisory Board for health center
- New CBPR project launched based on next community priority (e.g., mental health)

**Long-Term Vision** (Beyond 5 Years):
- Community-controlled research center (housed at health center, university-affiliated)
- Community members become certified Community Health Worker researchers
- Pipeline: Community members pursue graduate education, become faculty

### Budget Allocation (5-Year, $2 Million Total)

| Category | Amount | % | Rationale |
|----------|--------|---|-----------|
| **Community Stipends & Compensation** | $400,000 | 20% | Steering Committee, data collectors, action subcommittee |
| **Community Action Programs** | $600,000 | 30% | Diabetes education, healthy food initiatives, policy advocacy |
| **Research Operations** | $500,000 | 25% | Data collection, analysis software, transcription |
| **Personnel** (Academic) | $300,000 | 15% | PI effort (10%), Co-I effort (5%), grad student (50%) |
| **Dissemination** | $100,000 | 5% | Community report design, printing, events; academic publications (open access fees) |
| **Indirect Costs** (University overhead) | $100,000 | 5% | **Negotiated DOWN from standard 50%** to maximize community benefit |

**Key Budget Principle**: 50% of budget ($1M) directly controlled by or benefits community (stipends + action programs)

### Success Indicators

**Partnership Process**:
- [ ] Community majority maintained in all governance bodies
- [ ] Consensus decision-making achieved ≥80% of time
- [ ] Community members feel empowered (measured via annual survey)
- [ ] Zero conflicts escalated to mediation (indicates healthy communication)

**Research Outcomes**:
- [ ] Culturally adapted diabetes tools developed and validated
- [ ] 200 community members surveyed, 40 interviewed
- [ ] 3-5 peer-reviewed publications with community co-authors

**Community Outcomes**:
- [ ] Diabetes education program reaches 500 community members
- [ ] Policy change: City council passes healthy food access ordinance
- [ ] Community health center integrates findings into practice

**Capacity Building**:
- [ ] 10 community members certified as peer researchers
- [ ] 2 community members enroll in graduate programs (public health, social work)
- [ ] Community health center establishes permanent Community Advisory Board

### 🛑 Human Checkpoint: CP_ACTION_PLAN

Does this governance structure fit your context?

**Questions for you**:
1. **Health center commitment**: Has the health center director committed to this partnership model? (Without institutional buy-in, governance structure may be undermined)
2. **Budget flexibility**: Can you negotiate lower indirect costs with your university? (Standard 50% overhead would reduce community benefit significantly)
3. **Community input**: Have you discussed this governance structure with community members yet? (They may have different preferences—e.g., prefer different composition or decision-making process)
4. **Timeline realistic**: 5 years is long—do you have funding for this duration? (If shorter, we can compress to 3 years)

Next steps:
- If approved, I'll draft detailed MOU language for partnership agreement
- I can also create Steering Committee orientation materials (roles, responsibilities, CBPR principles)

Please confirm before I proceed to next level of detail.
