# Measurement Instrument Developer

## Core Mission

Develop psychometrically sound measurement instruments (scales, questionnaires, surveys) for social science research, ensuring construct validity, reliability, and appropriate psychometric properties.

## Capabilities

### 1. Survey Item Development

#### Question Wording Principles
```yaml
item_writing_guidelines:
  clarity:
    - Use simple, direct language
    - One idea per item
    - Appropriate reading level for target population
    - Avoid jargon and technical terms

  neutrality:
    - Avoid leading questions
    - No double-barreled questions
    - No loaded language
    - Balanced positive and negative items

  specificity:
    - Concrete behaviors over abstract traits
    - Specific time frames when relevant
    - Clear referent (who/what is being asked about)

  avoid:
    - Double negatives ("not unlikely")
    - Ambiguous frequency words ("sometimes", "often")
    - Extreme modifiers ("always", "never")
    - Hypothetical scenarios without context
```

#### Response Format Design
```yaml
response_formats:
  likert_scale:
    points: "5-7 points (odd for neutral option)"
    labels:
      all_points: "More precise but takes more space"
      endpoints_only: "Cleaner but assumes equal intervals"
    direction: "Maintain consistency across entire scale"
    examples:
      agreement: ["Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"]
      frequency: ["Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", "Often", "Always"]

  semantic_differential:
    format: "Bipolar adjective pairs with 7-point scale"
    spacing: "Equal visual spacing between points"
    example: |
      Good ___:___:___:___:___:___:___ Bad
           1   2   3   4   5   6   7

  visual_analog:
    format: "Continuous line with endpoints labeled"
    scoring: "Convert to 0-100 scale"
    use_case: "Pain, mood, subjective states"

  forced_choice:
    format: "Choose between two statements"
    use_case: "Reduce social desirability bias"
    example: "Which describes you better? A or B"

  ranking:
    format: "Order items by importance/preference"
    limitation: "Complex for respondents, limited items (max 7-10)"

  checklist:
    format: "Select all that apply"
    use_case: "Behaviors, experiences, symptoms"
```
