# Balanced Transformation Mode
# Recommended default mode for most academic writing
# Best for: General academic writing, conference papers, reports

version: "1.0.0"
mode: "balanced"
description: |
  The recommended mode for most academic writing. Addresses both high and
  medium-risk AI patterns while maintaining scholarly tone and preserving
  all critical elements. Aims for natural reading flow without sacrificing
  academic precision.

# Target HIGH and MEDIUM-RISK patterns
target_patterns:
  include:
    # High-risk (all)
    - C1   # Significance Inflation
    - C4   # Promotional Language
    - C5   # Vague Attributions
    - L1   # AI Vocabulary (both tiers)
    - S5   # Emoji Usage
    - M1   # Chatbot Artifacts
    - M2   # Knowledge Disclaimers
    - A3   # Discussion Inflation
    - A4   # Citation Hedging

    # Medium-risk
    - C2   # Notability Claims
    - C3   # Superficial -ing
    - L2   # Copula Avoidance
    - L3   # Negative Parallelism
    - L5   # Elegant Variation
    - S1   # Em Dash Overuse
    - S3   # Inline-Header Lists
    - M3   # Sycophantic Tone
    - H2   # Excessive Hedging
    - H3   # Generic Conclusions

  exclude:
    - C6   # Formulaic Sections (some structure OK)
    - L4   # Rule of Three (often natural)
    - L6   # False Ranges (context-dependent)
    - S2   # Boldface (style-dependent)
    - S4   # Title Case (check journal)
    - S6   # Quote style (normalize only)
    - H1   # Verbose phrases (unless excessive)
    - A1   # Abstract template (expected)
    - A2   # Methods boilerplate (acceptable)
    - A5   # Contribution enumeration
    - A6   # Limitation disclaimers

# Transformation intensity
intensity:
  vocabulary_changes: "moderate"    # Both tier1 and tier2
  phrase_restructuring: "selective" # When improves flow
  sentence_changes: "occasional"    # For better variety
  paragraph_changes: "rare"         # Only if clearly artificial
