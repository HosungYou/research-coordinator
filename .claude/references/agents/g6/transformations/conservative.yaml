# Conservative Transformation Mode
# Minimal changes, maximum preservation
# Best for: Journal submissions, formal academic documents

version: "1.0.0"
mode: "conservative"
description: |
  Transforms only the most obvious AI patterns that would be immediately
  flagged by readers or AI detection systems. Preserves as much original
  text as possible while addressing critical issues.

# Target only HIGH-RISK patterns
target_patterns:
  include:
    - C1   # Significance Inflation
    - C4   # Promotional Language
    - C5   # Vague Attributions
    - L1_tier1  # AI Vocabulary (high alert only)
    - S5   # Emoji Usage
    - M1   # Chatbot Artifacts
    - M2   # Knowledge Disclaimers

  exclude:
    - C2, C3, C6  # Medium content patterns
    - L1_tier2    # Moderate AI vocabulary
    - L2-L6       # Other language patterns
    - S1-S4, S6   # Most style patterns
    - M3          # Sycophantic (unless extreme)
    - H1-H3       # Filler patterns
    - A1-A6       # Academic-specific

# Transformation intensity
intensity:
  vocabulary_changes: "minimal"  # Only tier1 AI words
  phrase_restructuring: "rare"   # Only when essential
  sentence_changes: "avoid"      # Preserve original structure
  paragraph_changes: "never"     # Keep organization

# Specific transformations for conservative mode
transformations:
  # C1: Significance Inflation
  C1:
    approach: "downgrade_only_extreme"
    apply_when: "Word is clearly hyperbolic"
    preserve_when: "Describing genuinely significant work"
    examples:
      transform:
        - ["revolutionizes", "advances"]
        - ["paradigm-shifting", "innovative"]
        - ["groundbreaking", "novel"]
      preserve:
        - "significant" # (if p-value context)
        - "important"   # (moderate claim)
        - "novel"       # (acceptable)

  # C4: Promotional Language
  C4:
    approach: "neutralize_obvious"
    apply_when: "Marketing-style adjectives"
    examples:
      transform:
        - ["cutting-edge", "current"]
        - ["state-of-the-art", "established"]
        - ["exciting", "notable"]
        - ["remarkable", "substantial"]

  # C5: Vague Attributions
  C5:
    approach: "require_citation_or_rephrase"
    apply_when: "No citation within 2 sentences"
    examples:
      transform:
        - before: "Studies have shown that X"
          after: "[Citation needed] found that X"
          note: "Flag for author to add citation"
        - before: "Experts agree that X"
          after: "Research suggests that X [citation needed]"
