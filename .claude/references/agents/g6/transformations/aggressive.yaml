# Aggressive Transformation Mode
# Maximum naturalness, extensive changes
# Best for: Blog posts, informal writing, social media summaries

version: "1.0.0"
mode: "aggressive"
description: |
  Maximum transformation for texts where naturalness is prioritized over
  preserving original structure. Addresses all detected patterns and
  actively restructures for human-like flow. Use with caution for formal
  academic writing.
