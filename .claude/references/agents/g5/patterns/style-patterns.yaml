  S1:
    name: "Em Dash Overuse"
    risk_level: "medium"
    description: |
      AI models use em dashes (—) far more frequently than typical human writing.
      Academic writing traditionally uses parentheses, commas, or separate sentences.

    indicators:
      characters:
        - "—"   # em dash
        - "--"  # double hyphen (sometimes converted)
        - "–"   # en dash (sometimes confused)

      thresholds:
        per_paragraph: 2     # More than 2 per paragraph = flag
        per_document: 5      # More than 5 in short doc = flag
        per_1000_words: 3    # Density threshold

      patterns:
        - "X—Y—Z"  # Multiple em dashes in one sentence
        - "—and"   # Em dash before conjunction
        - "—which" # Em dash before relative pronoun

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Single use for strong interruption"
        - "Formatting direct quotes"
        - "Journal style specifically allows"

      preferred_alternatives:
        - "Use parentheses for asides"
        - "Use commas for light interruption"
        - "Use colons for elaboration"
        - "Create separate sentences"

    transformations:
      # Replace with appropriate punctuation based on context
      parenthetical: "( )"  # For tangential information
      list_intro: ":"       # For introducing lists
      continuation: ","     # For light interruption

  S2:
    name: "Excessive Boldface"
    risk_level: "low"
    description: |
      AI tends to bold key terms mechanically throughout text,
      which disrupts reading flow and appears robotic.

    indicators:
      patterns:
        - "**term**"  # Markdown bold
        - "<b>term</b>"
        - "<strong>term</strong>"

      thresholds:
        per_paragraph: 3     # More than 3 bolded terms = flag
        per_section: 10      # Excessive emphasis

      red_flags:
        - Bolding common words ("**the** study")
        - Bolding every key term first mention
        - Bolding for emphasis rather than definition
        - Inconsistent bolding patterns

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "First definition of key term (once)"
        - "Table/figure headers"
        - "Section headings"
        - "Journal style requires bold for emphasis"

      not_acceptable:
        - "Repeated bolding of same term"
        - "Bolding common academic words"
        - "Bolding for visual variety"

    transformations:
      recommendation: "Remove most bolding; use only for true key term definitions"

  S3:
    name: "Inline-Header Lists"
    risk_level: "medium"
    description: |
      AI produces lists with bolded headers followed by colons,
      creating a corporate/technical writing style inappropriate for most academic prose.

    indicators:
      patterns:
        - "**Header**: Description text"
        - "**Term**: Definition following"
        - "1. **Point**: Explanation"

      characteristics:
        - Every list item starts with bold header
        - Colon always follows bold term
        - Parallel structure is rigid
        - Feels like documentation, not prose

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Appendix or supplementary materials"
        - "Technical specifications section"
        - "Glossary or definition lists"
        - "Methods with many distinct steps"

      not_acceptable:
        - "Main body prose"
        - "Discussion section"
        - "Abstract"
        - "Literature review"

    transformations:
      recommendation: "Convert to flowing prose or use standard enumerated lists"
      example_before: |
        **Finding 1**: Students showed improved scores.
        **Finding 2**: Teachers reported satisfaction.
      example_after: |
        First, students showed improved scores. Second, teachers reported satisfaction.

  S4:
    name: "Title Case Overuse"
    risk_level: "low"
    description: |
      AI capitalizes headings in Title Case when sentence case is more appropriate.
      Most modern style guides prefer sentence case for headings.

    indicators:
      patterns:
        # Title Case: Capitalizing All Main Words
        - "Implications For Future Research"
        - "Challenges And Opportunities"
        - "The Role Of Technology"

      # Check against style guides
      style_guide_conflicts:
        APA7: "Sentence case for headings level 3-5"
        Chicago: "Sentence case preferred for most"
        AMA: "Sentence case for subheadings"

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Level 1 headings (some styles)"
        - "Journal explicitly requires Title Case"
        - "Book chapter titles"

      check_journal_style: true

    transformations:
      "Implications For Future Research": "Implications for future research"
      "The Role Of Technology": "The role of technology"
      recommendation: "Check target journal style guide; default to sentence case"

  S5:
    name: "Emoji Usage"
    risk_level: "high"
    description: |
      Decorative emojis are inappropriate in academic writing
      and strongly signal AI-generated or casual content.

    indicators:
      characters:
        # Common AI emojis
        - "🔍"  # Investigation
        - "📊"  # Data
        - "💡"  # Insight
        - "🚀"  # Progress
        - "✅"  # Checkmark
        - "❌"  # X mark
        - "⭐"  # Star
        - "📚"  # Books
        - "🔬"  # Research
        - "📈"  # Chart
        - "💻"  # Computer
        - "🎯"  # Target
        - "⚠️"  # Warning
        - "ℹ️"  # Info

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Never in academic prose"
        - "Possibly in informal lab notes"
        - "Social media summary versions only"

      always_remove: true

    transformations:
      recommendation: "Remove all emojis from academic text"

  S6:
    name: "Curly Quote Artifacts"
    risk_level: "low"
    description: |
      Inconsistent quotation mark styles (curly vs. straight) can signal
      AI-generated text or text assembled from multiple sources.

    indicators:
      characters:
        curly_quotes:
          - """  # Left double curly
          - """  # Right double curly
          - "'"  # Left single curly
          - "'"  # Right single curly

        straight_quotes:
          - '"'  # Straight double
          - "'"  # Straight single

      red_flags:
        - Mixed curly and straight in same document
        - Mismatched opening/closing quotes
        - Inconsistent apostrophe style

    academic_context:
      # Most academic publishers prefer straight quotes
      # But some use curly - check style guide

      check_consistency: true
      preferred_default: "straight"

    transformations:
      recommendation: "Normalize to one style; check journal requirements"
      """ → '"'
      """ → '"'
      "'" → "'"
      "'" → "'"

# Additional Style Checks for Academic Writing

academic_specific_style:
  paragraph_length:
    warning_threshold: 300  # words - very long paragraphs may signal AI
    recommendation: "Break into focused paragraphs"

  sentence_length:
    average_threshold: 35  # words - AI tends toward longer sentences
    recommendation: "Vary sentence length; aim for 15-25 average"

  passive_voice_density:
    threshold: 0.4  # 40% passive = check
    note: "AI often overuses passive voice; methods section exception"

  hedge_density:
    threshold: 0.15  # Hedging words per sentence
    hedge_words: ["may", "might", "could", "possibly", "perhaps", "potentially"]
    recommendation: "Reduce excessive hedging"

# Scoring
