(2009) for meta-analysis\n- More accurate when synthesizing studies with varied sample sizes\n\n### For Your Research\n\nGiven that K-12 studies often have:\n- Classroom-level samples (n = 20-40)\n- Varied sample sizes across studies\n\n**Hedges' g is recommended** because:\n1. Corrects for small sample upward bias\n2. More accurate pooled estimates\n3. Standard practice in educational meta-analyses\n\n### References\n- Hedges, L. V. (1981).
