Charmaz says: use it reflexively, acknowledge it\n\n2. **Burnout literature exists** - Glaserian approach demands you ignore Maslach, Leiter, etc. until after analysis. Practically difficult and arguably wasteful\n\n3. **Sensitive topic** - Developer burnout involves power dynamics (employer-employee), stigma, vulnerability. Charmaz's emphasis on researcher-participant relationship and co-construction fits better\n\n4. **Process focus** - Both handle process well, but Charmaz's situational analysis tools (social worlds/arenas mapping) work well for understanding remote work contexts\n\n**Glaserian might be better if:**\n- You genuinely have NO prior knowledge of burnout research\n- You want maximum publishability in journals favoring \"pure\" GT\n- Your committee/advisor is Glaserian\n\n---\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n| Aspect | If Glaserian | If Charmaz |\n|--------|--------------|------------|\n| **Before interviews** | No burnout literature | Read burnout lit, write reflexive memo on your assumptions |\n| **During interviews** | Minimize self-disclosure | Some reciprocity acceptable |\n| **In analysis** | \"The data told me...\" | \"I interpreted the data as...\" |\n| **In writing** | Passive voice, theory-focused | Active voice, process-focused |\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 CHECKPOINT: Grounded Theory Tradition Selection\n\nWhich approach fits your situation?\n\n- **[C]** Constructivist (Charmaz) - I have domain knowledge and want to acknowledge my role *(Recommended for your context)*\n- **[G]** Classic (Glaser) - I want theory to emerge with minimal researcher influence\n- **[S]** Straussian (Strauss & Corbin) - I want structured procedures with paradigm model\n- **[?]** Still unsure - tell me more about my specific situation\n\nYour answer will shape how I configure the research design agents.\n",

Can you take me back to when you first started noticing something wasn't right?\"\n\n---\n\n### Analysis Procedures\n\n```\nInitial Coding (interviews 1-10)\n  • Line-by-line coding\n  • Use gerunds (-ing words)\n  • Stay close to data\n        ↓\nFocused Coding (interviews 8-15)\n  • Elevate frequent/significant codes\n  • Develop category properties and dimensions\n        ↓\nTheoretical Coding (interviews 15+)\n  • Integrate categories\n  • Map process relationships\n  • Develop theoretical model\n        ↓\nSaturation Assessment\n  • No new codes for 3+ interviews\n  • Categories fully dimensionalized\n  • Process model accounts for variations\n```\n\n**Memo-writing:** After every interview + weekly theoretical memos + bi-weekly reflexive memos\n\n---\n\n### Quality Criteria (Charmaz)\n\n| Criterion | Strategy |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Credibility** | Prolonged engagement, audit trail, member checking |\n| **Originality** | VS methodology ensures non-modal theory |\n| **Resonance** | Share theory with participants and developer communities |\n| **Usefulness** | Assess actionability for developers, managers, organizations |\n\n---\n\n### Reflexivity Protocol\n\n- Complete positionality statement before data collection\n- Maintain reflexive memos throughout\n- Conduct assumption audit\n- Seek peer debriefing regularly\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n| Step | Action | Agent Support |\n|------|--------|---------------|\n| **1** | Write positionality statement | Template provided by A5 |\n| **2** | Draft interview guide | D2-InterviewFocusGroupSpecialist |\n| **3** | Prepare ethics/IRB application | A4-ResearchEthicsAdvisor |\n| **4** | Develop recruitment strategy | D1-SamplingStrategyAdvisor |\n| **5** | Set up analysis infrastructure | Memo templates, coding software |\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 CHECKPOINT: Next Step Selection\n\nWhich would you like to work on first?\n\n- **[I]** Interview guide — Draft the flexible guide for intensive interviews\n- **[E]** Ethics/IRB — Prepare consent forms and ethics application\n- **[P]** Positionality statement — Complete your researcher positioning\n- **[R]** Recruitment — Develop strategy to find participants\n- **[A]** All of the above — Generate comprehensive preparation package\n",
