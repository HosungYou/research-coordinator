## Turn 1: 👤 USER

I want to study how software developers experience burnout
in remote work environments. I'm interested in understanding
the process they go through - from early warning signs to
either recovery or leaving the profession. I don't have
preconceived hypotheses, I want the theory to emerge from data.

---

## Turn 1: 🤖 ASSISTANT

<command-name>/diverga:research-coordinator</command-name>

I'll help you design this research study. Based on your description, I'm detecting several important signals:

**Paradigm Detection:**
- "understand the process" → Qualitative
- "early warning signs to recovery or leaving" → Process/trajectory focus
- "theory to emerge from data" → **Grounded Theory** methodology
- "no preconceived hypotheses" → Inductive approach

---

## 🔴 CHECKPOINT: Paradigm Confirmation

Before proceeding, I need to confirm your research approach:

**Detected Paradigm:** Qualitative Research - Grounded Theory

Is this correct?

- **[Q]** Yes, proceed with Grounded Theory
- **[P]** I prefer Phenomenology (focus on lived experience)
- **[C]** I prefer Case Study approach
- **[M]** Actually, I want Mixed Methods
- **[?]** I'm not sure, help me decide

Please confirm so I can activate the appropriate agents (A1-ResearchQuestionRefiner, A5-ParadigmWorldviewAdvisor, C2-QualitativeDesignConsultant).


**Checkpoints Detected**: Paradigm

**Agents Detected**: C2, A5, A1

## Turn 2: 👤 USER

You mentioned Glaser vs Charmaz. What's the practical difference?
I've heard Glaser is more purist about letting theory emerge,
while Charmaz acknowledges researcher influence. Which approach
would be better for my study on developer burnout?

---

## Turn 2: 🤖 ASSISTANT

Great question. This is a critical methodological decision. Let me explain the practical differences and help you choose.

---

## Grounded Theory Traditions: Practical Comparison

| Dimension | **Classic/Glaserian** | **Constructivist (Charmaz)** |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Epistemology** | Objectivist - theory "emerges" from data | Constructivist - theory is "constructed" with data |
| **Literature Review** | Delay until after analysis (avoid contamination) | Engage early, use reflexively |
| **Researcher Role** | Neutral observer, minimize influence | Active co-constructor, acknowledge influence |
| **Memo Style** | Abstract, conceptual | Reflexive, includes positionality |
| **Coding** | Open → Selective → Theoretical | Initial → Focused → Theoretical |
| **Core Category** | Must identify ONE core category | Multiple categories acceptable |
| **Writing Voice** | Third person, detached | First person acceptable |

---

## For Your Developer Burnout Study

**Charmaz (Constructivist) may be better because:**

1. **You have domain knowledge** - If you've worked in tech/remote work, Glaser would say this "contaminates" your analysis. Charmaz says: use it reflexively, acknowledge it

2. **Burnout literature exists** - Glaserian approach demands you ignore Maslach, Leiter, etc. until after analysis. Practically difficult and arguably wasteful

3. **Sensitive topic** - Developer burnout involves power dynamics (employer-employee), stigma, vulnerability. Charmaz's emphasis on researcher-participant relationship and co-construction fits better

4. **Process focus** - Both handle process well, but Charmaz's situational analysis tools (social worlds/arenas mapping) work well for understanding remote work contexts

**Glaserian might be better if:**
- You genuinely have NO prior knowledge of burnout research
- You want maximum publishability in journals favoring "pure" GT
- Your committee/advisor is Glaserian

---

## Practical Implications

| Aspect | If Glaserian | If Charmaz |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Before interviews** | No burnout literature | Read burnout lit, write reflexive memo on your assumptions |
| **During interviews** | Minimize self-disclosure | Some reciprocity acceptable |
| **In analysis** | "The data told me..." | "I interpreted the data as..." |
| **In writing** | Passive voice, theory-focused | Active voice, process-focused |

---

## 🔴 CHECKPOINT: Grounded Theory Tradition Selection

Which approach fits your situation?

- **[C]** Constructivist (Charmaz) - I have domain knowledge and want to acknowledge my role *(Recommended for your context)*
- **[G]** Classic (Glaser) - I want theory to emerge with minimal researcher influence
- **[S]** Straussian (Strauss & Corbin) - I want structured procedures with paradigm model
- **[?]** Still unsure - tell me more about my specific situation

Your answer will shape how I configure the research design agents.

## Agent Results Integrated

Three agents have completed their analysis. Here's the consolidated output:

---

## 🔴 CHECKPOINT: Research Question Selection

**Agent A1 (Research Question Refiner)** has generated three differentiated options using VS methodology:

| Option | T-Score | Research Question |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **A** | 0.65 (Safe) | "How do software developers in remote work environments navigate the trajectory from initial exhaustion signals to critical decision points about their professional futures?" |
| **B** | 0.42 (Balanced) ⭐ | "What social-psychological processes underlie the construction and reconstruction of professional identity among remote software developers as they encounter, resist, succumb to, or transcend conditions of chronic occupational strain?" |
| **C** | 0.28 (Innovative) | "Through what interactional and interpretive processes do remote software developers construct meanings around 'staying' versus 'leaving' when occupational sustainability becomes contested?" |

**Agent Recommendation: Option B** — The identity construction framing aligns exceptionally well with Charmaz's constructivist emphasis and offers genuine theoretical contribution while remaining defensible.

**Please select:**
- **[A]** Trajectory-focused (safer, clear process model)
- **[B]** Identity process (recommended — rich theoretical territory)
- **[C]** Meaning-making around staying/leaving (innovative but higher scrutiny)
- **[?]** Need clarification or want to discuss a hybrid

---

## Design Framework Summary (Agent C2)

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Initial Sampling** | 12-18 participants across career stages × outcome paths (recovery/exit) |
| **Theoretical Sampling** | Pivot after interviews 6-8 based on emerging categories |
| **Final Sample** | 20-30 participants (saturation-dependent) |
| **Data Collection** | Intensive interviews (60-90 min) + secondary data (blogs, Reddit, public posts) |
| **Analysis** | Initial → Focused → Theoretical coding with continuous memo-writing |
| **Timeline** | 8-12 months total |

---

## Philosophical Foundations (Agent A5)

| Dimension | Your Position |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Ontology** | Relativist — burnout is constructed, not discovered |
| **Epistemology** | Social constructionist — knowledge co-created with participants |
| **Axiology** | Value-laden — researcher values acknowledged, not hidden |
| **Quality Criteria** | Credibility, Originality, Resonance, Usefulness (Charmaz) |

A **positionality statement template** has been generated for you to complete before data collection.

---

**Next Steps After RQ Selection:**
1. Finalize research question wording
2. Complete positionality statement
3. Draft interview guide (Agent D2)
4. Ethics/IRB preparation (Agent A4)

Which research question direction would you like to pursue?

## Turn 4: 👤 USER

How should I do sampling? I know grounded theory uses
theoretical sampling, but how do I start when I don't
have a theory yet? And how many participants do I need?

---

## Turn 4: 🤖 ASSISTANT

Great question — this is a common confusion in grounded theory. Let me clarify the sampling sequence.

---

## CGT Sampling: Two-Phase Approach

You don't start with theoretical sampling. Charmaz is clear about this:

```
Phase 1: PURPOSIVE SAMPLING (beginning)
    ↓
    Initial data collection & coding
    ↓
    Categories begin emerging
    ↓
Phase 2: THEORETICAL SAMPLING (ongoing)
    ↓
    Sample to develop/test categories
    ↓
    Until theoretical saturation
```

---

## Phase 1: Initial Purposive Sampling

**Purpose:** Get started with participants who have relevant experience

**For your study, initial criteria:**

| Criterion | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Role** | Software developers/engineers | Direct experience with technical work |
| **Work mode** | 80%+ remote for 12+ months | Sustained remote exposure |
| **Burnout experience** | Self-identified episode | Ensures relevant experience |
| **Recency** | Within past 3 years | Detailed recall possible |
| **Outcome variation** | Mix of recovery AND exit | Capture full process range |

**Initial Sampling Matrix:**

```
                      Recovered    Left Profession
                      ─────────    ───────────────
Early career (< 5yr)     2-3            2-3

Mid career (5-15yr)      2-3            2-3

Senior (15+ yr)          2-3            2-3
```

**Start with:** 12-18 participants across these cells

---

## Phase 2: Theoretical Sampling

**When to shift:** After interviews 6-8, when categories emerge

**How it works:**

| You notice... | You sample for... |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Isolation" emerging as key category | Developers who DIDN'T feel isolated (negative cases) |
| All participants from startups | Enterprise/corporate developers |
| Recovery process unclear | More people who successfully recovered |
| "Async overload" appears | High-async vs. low-async environments |

**Theoretical sampling questions to ask yourself:**

> "What type of participant would challenge, extend, or refine my emerging categories?"

---

## Sample Size: The Honest Answer

**Charmaz's position:** Sample size is determined by **theoretical saturation**, not predetermined numbers.

**Practical reality for CGT studies:**

| Study Type | Typical Range | Your Study |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Doctoral dissertation | 20-30 | ✓ Recommended |
| Journal article | 15-25 | Acceptable |
| Funded research | 30-50 | If resources allow |

**Saturation indicators (when to stop):**

| Indicator | How to Assess |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Code saturation** | 3+ interviews produce no new codes |
| **Category saturation** | Can fully describe properties and dimensions |
| **Process saturation** | Can trace any case through your model |
| **Negative case integration** | Exceptions explained by theory |

---

## Practical Sampling Protocol

**Weeks 1-8: Purposive Phase**
```
Interview 1-4:  Recruit from matrix cells (varied)
     ↓
     Code immediately after each interview
     ↓
Interview 5-8:  Continue purposive, begin noticing patterns
     ↓
     Write "theoretical sampling memo"
     ↓
     Identify: What's missing? What needs elaboration?
```

**Weeks 9+: Theoretical Phase**
```
Interview 9-12: Sample based on emerging categories
     ↓
     "I need someone who [specific characteristic]
      because my category of [X] is underdeveloped"
     ↓
Interview 13-20: Fill gaps, seek negative cases
     ↓
     Assess saturation after each interview
     ↓
Interview 21-30: Confirm saturation, test theory
```

---

## 🔴 CHECKPOINT: Sampling Strategy Confirmation

**Proposed approach for your study:**

1. **Start:** 12-18 purposive (varied by career stage × outcome)
2. **Shift:** To theoretical sampling after interviews 6-8
3. **Target:** 20-30 total (saturation-dependent)
4. **Stop when:** 3+ interviews with no new codes AND categories fully developed

**Does this approach work for your context?**

- **[Y]** Yes, proceed with this sampling plan
- **[R]** I have resource constraints (fewer participants possible?)
- **[A]** I have access to more participants (should I sample more?)
- **[?]** I have questions about recruitment or access

## Turn 5: 👤 USER

This makes sense. I'll start with 8-10 developers from
different companies and then do theoretical sampling
based on emerging categories. Please summarize the
methodology and give me next steps.
