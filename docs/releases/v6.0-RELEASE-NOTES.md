# Diverga v6.0 Release Notes

## Human-Centered Edition

**Release Date**: 2026-01-25
**Version**: 6.0.1

---

## Overview

Diverga v6.0 represents a fundamental shift in design philosophy: from autonomous AI operation to **human-centered collaboration**. This release removes all mechanisms that could bypass human decision-making, ensuring that strategic research choices always remain with the researcher.

---

## Core Philosophy

> **"Human decisions remain with humans. AI handles what's beyond human scope."**
> **"인간이 할 일은 인간이, AI는 인간의 범주를 벗어난 것을 수행"**

---

## What's New

### 1. Mandatory Human Checkpoint System

Three-tier checkpoint system that **cannot be bypassed**:

| Level | Icon | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| **REQUIRED** | 🔴 | System STOPS - Cannot proceed without explicit approval |
| **RECOMMENDED** | 🟠 | System PAUSES - Strongly suggests approval |
| **OPTIONAL** | 🟡 | System ASKS - Defaults available if skipped |

#### Required Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | When | What Happens |
|------------|------|--------------|
| `CP_RESEARCH_DIRECTION` | Research question finalized | Present VS options, WAIT for selection |
| `CP_PARADIGM_SELECTION` | Methodology approach | Ask Quantitative/Qualitative/Mixed |
| `CP_THEORY_SELECTION` | Framework chosen | Present alternatives with T-Scores |
| `CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL` | Design complete | Detailed review required |

### 2. Agent Restructuring (v6.0.1)

**33 agents** organized into **8 categories** with consistent naming:

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| A: Foundation | 6 | A1-research-question-refiner, A2-theoretical-framework-architect |
| B: Evidence | 4 | B1-systematic-literature-scout, B2-evidence-quality-appraiser |
| C: Design | 4 | C1-quantitative-design-consultant, C2-qualitative-design-consultant |
| D: Data Collection | 4 | D1-sampling-strategy-advisor, D2-interview-focus-group-specialist |
| E: Analysis | 5 | E1-quantitative-analysis-guide, E2-qualitative-coding-specialist |
| F: Quality | 4 | F1-internal-consistency-checker, F2-checklist-manager |
| G: Communication | 4 | G1-journal-matcher, G2-academic-communicator |
| H: Specialized | 2 | H1-ethnographic-research-advisor, H2-action-research-facilitator |

### 3. Clean Architecture

All state and configuration consolidated under `.claude/`:

```
.claude/
├── skills/
│   ├── research-coordinator/
│   ├── research-orchestrator/
│   └── research-agents/

## What Was Removed

### Sisyphus Protocol ❌

- **Was**: "Work never stops until complete"
- **Problem**: Could bypass human checkpoints, enabling autonomous operation without approval
- **Now**: AI stops at EVERY checkpoint and waits for human decision

### Iron Law of Continuation ❌

- **Was**: "Move to next agent OR human checkpoint"
- **Problem**: The "OR" made checkpoints optional, allowing AI to skip them
- **Now**: Sequential flow: "checkpoint THEN next agent"

### OMC Autonomous Modes ❌

| Removed Mode | Problem |
|--------------|---------|
| `ralph` | Persistence mode that could bypass checkpoints |
| `ultrawork` | Maximum parallelism without human oversight |
| `autopilot` | Full autonomous execution |
| `ecomode` | Token-efficient mode that skipped confirmations |
| `swarm` | Multi-agent coordination without checkpoints |
| `ultrapilot` | Parallel autopilot without approval |

**Kept**: Model routing (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku tiers) - this only affects cost/performance, not human oversight

### Legacy Folder Structure ❌

- Removed: `.omc/` folder and all contents
- Migrated: Necessary configuration moved to `.claude/`

---

## Migration Guide

### From v5.0 (Sisyphus Edition)

1. **Delete `.omc/` folder** (if it exists)
   ```bash
   rm -rf .omc/
   ```

2. **Update your workflow expectations**:
   - AI will now STOP at checkpoints and WAIT for your approval
   - No more autonomous "ralph" or "ultrawork" modes
   - You must explicitly approve research direction, theory selection, and methodology

3. **Model routing still works**:
   - Use `haiku` for simple tasks (effect size extraction, code generation)
   - Use `sonnet` for standard tasks (literature search, quality appraisal)
   - Use `opus` for strategic tasks (theory selection, analysis design)

### Breaking Changes

| Feature | v5.0 | v6.0 |
|---------|------|------|
| Checkpoints | Optional (could be bypassed) | Mandatory |
| OMC modes | ralph, ultrawork, ecomode available | Removed |
| Agent naming | Numbered (01-21) | Category-based (A1-H2) |
| State location | `.omc/` | `.claude/` |
| Agent count | 27 | 33 |

---

## Model Routing (v6.0.1)

| Tier | Model | Count | Use Case |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| HIGH | Opus | 14 | Strategic decisions (A1, A2, A3, A5, C1-C3, D4, E1-E3, G3, H1-H2) |
| MEDIUM | Sonnet | 13 | Standard analysis (A4, A6, B1-B2, C4, D1-D2, E5, F3-F4, G1-G2, G4) |
| LOW | Haiku | 6 | Routine tasks (B3-B4, D3, E4, F1-F2) |

## VS Methodology (Enhanced)

The Verbalized Sampling methodology remains the core innovation, now enhanced with mandatory human selection at each VS checkpoint:

```
Stage 1: Context & Modal Identification
  └─ Identify "obvious" recommendations (T > 0.8)

Stage 2: Divergent Exploration
  ├─ Direction A (T≈0.6): Safe but differentiated
  ├─ Direction B (T≈0.4): Balanced novelty ⭐
  └─ Direction C (T<0.3): Innovative/experimental

Stage 3: Human Selection (🔴 CHECKPOINT)
  ├─ Present ALL options with T-Scores
  ├─ WAIT for human decision
  └─ Execute ONLY selected direction
```
