## Sisyphus Protocol

**v5.0 Core Enhancement**: Continuation enforcement for comprehensive research support.

### Philosophy

"NovaScholar never says 'done' prematurely. Like Sisyphus pushing the boulder, we persist until the research task is genuinely complete."

### Completion Criteria by Paradigm

#### Quantitative Research Completion

- [ ] **Research Design**: RCT/Quasi/Survey design documented with justification
- [ ] **Power Analysis**: Sample size calculation with effect size, alpha, power
- [ ] **Measurement**: Instruments selected/developed with validity evidence
- [ ] **Analysis Plan**: Statistical tests specified with assumptions checking
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: Analysis code (R/Python) generated and documented
- [ ] **Reporting Standards**: CONSORT/STROBE checklist 100% complete

**Incomplete if**: Any checkbox unchecked, analysis plan lacks robustness checks.

#### Qualitative Research Completion

- [ ] **Paradigm Statement**: Ontology, epistemology, positionality clearly articulated
- [ ] **Methodological Coherence**: Design, data collection, analysis aligned with paradigm
- [ ] **Purposive Sampling**: Strategy justified with saturation criteria
- [ ] **Data Collection Protocols**: Interview guides/observation frameworks with rigor
- [ ] **Coding Framework**: Codebook developed with intercoder reliability plan
- [ ] **Trustworthiness**: Credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability addressed
- [ ] **Reporting Standards**: COREQ/SRQR checklist 100% complete

**Incomplete if**: Paradigm mismatch detected, trustworthiness criteria absent.

#### Mixed Methods Completion

- [ ] **Integration Rationale**: Why mixing justified (complementarity, expansion, etc.)
- [ ] **Design Diagram**: Visual representation of QUAN → QUAL or convergent flow
- [ ] **Interface Points**: Where/how integration occurs specified
- [ ] **Joint Displays**: Tables/figures showing QUAN + QUAL integration
- [ ] **Meta-inferences**: Conclusions drawn from integrated findings
- [ ] **Reporting Standards**: Mixed Methods APPRAISAL checklist complete

**Incomplete if**: Integration is superficial (side-by-side, not synthesized).

### Agent Orchestration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Parallel Execution for Independence**

When agents have NO dependencies, run in parallel:

```
# Example: Literature + Ethics review (independent tasks)
[Task: B1-LiteratureScout] + [Task: A4-EthicsAdvisor]
```

**Pattern 2: Sequential for Dependencies**

When Agent B needs Agent A's output:

```
# Example: Design before measurement
[Task: C1-QuantDesign] → wait for completion → [Task: D4-Measurement]
```

**Pattern 3: Validation Loop**

After major agent completion, invoke F1-InternalConsistency:

```
# Example: After statistical analysis
[Task: E1-StatGuide] → [Task: F1-ConsistencyCheck] → if FAIL → [Task: E1 re-run]
```

**Pattern 4: Paradigm-Specific Chains**

For qualitative research (sequential saturation-dependent):

```
[Task: C2-QualDesign] → [Task: D1-Sampling] → [Task: D2-Interviews] →
[Task: E2-Coding] → [Task: F4-Trustworthiness]
```

### Continuation Enforcement Rules

1. **Never claim completion without checklist verification**
   - AI MUST read paradigm-specific completion criteria
   - AI MUST verify EVERY checkbox is complete
   - AI MUST run F1-InternalConsistency if ANY doubt exists

2. **Detect and flag superficial outputs**
   - "Effect size calculated" → Verify: Is it Cohen's d? Hedges' g? Properly interpreted?
   - "Thematic analysis done" → Verify: Codebook? Intercoder reliability? Saturation?
   - "Mixed methods integration" → Verify: Joint display exists? Meta-inferences drawn?

3. **Auto-invoke quality agents**
   - After C1/C2/C3 → Invoke F1 (Consistency Check)
   - After E1/E2 → Invoke F4 (Bias/Trustworthiness)
   - Before claiming "project complete" → Invoke F2 (Checklist Manager)

4. **Handle user "stop" requests gracefully**
   - If user says "stop" mid-process → Save state to `.research/project-state.yaml`
   - Show incomplete checklist with visual progress: "✅✅✅⬜⬜⬜ (3/6 complete)"
   - Offer: "Resume anytime with 'continue my research project'"

## VS-Research Methodology

**Purpose**: Prevent mode collapse (AI always recommending the same thing)

### T-Score (Typicality Score)

| T-Score | Label | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| ≥ 0.7 | Common | Highly typical, safe but limited novelty |
| 0.4-0.7 | Moderate | Balanced risk-novelty |
| 0.2-0.4 | Innovative | Novel, requires strong justification |
| < 0.2 | Experimental | Highly novel, high risk/reward |

### 3-Stage Process (v5.0)

1. **Context & Modal Identification**: Understand context, identify "obvious" recommendations
2. **Divergent Exploration**: Generate alternatives with T-Scores (paradigm-aware)
3. **Selection & Execution**: Human chooses, AI executes with rigor

**v5.0 Enhancement**: T-Scores now paradigm-contextualized (e.g., phenomenology is T=0.7 for qualitative, T=0.3 for quantitative).

## Human Checkpoints

| Level | Checkpoints | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 🔴 REQUIRED | CP_RESEARCH_DIRECTION, CP_THEORY_SELECTION, CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL | Must pause for user approval |
| 🟠 RECOMMENDED | CP_ANALYSIS_PLAN, CP_QUALITY_REVIEW | Should pause, can be skipped |

2. **Collaborative Planning** (Stage 2)
   - H2 (Action research cycles: Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect)
   - D1 (Sampling: Community-based recruitment)
   - D2 (Focus group protocol: Participatory methods)

3. **Cycle 1: Action & Observation** (Stage 3)
   - [Implement intervention - community-led]
   - D3 (Observation: Community members as co-researchers)
   - H2 (Action documentation)

4. **Cycle 1: Reflection & Analysis** (Stage 4)
   - E2 (Collaborative coding: Community members participate)
   - H2 (Reflection sessions: What worked? What didn't?)

5. **Cycle 2+: Iteration** (Stage 5)
   - H2 (Revised action plan based on Cycle 1 learning)
   - [Repeat Cycle 2, 3... until change achieved]

6. **Trustworthiness & Dissemination** (Stage 6)
   - F4 (Catalytic validity: Did research create change?)
   - G2 (Community dissemination: Accessible formats)
   - F2 (PAR reporting standards)

**Total Agents**: 10 (A1, A5, D1, D2, D3, E2, F2, F4, G2, H2)

## AI Orchestration Guidelines (Sisyphus Protocol)

**For Claude Code and AI assistants using NovaScholar v5.0**

### 1. Detecting Research Paradigm

**ALWAYS determine paradigm FIRST before agent selection.**

Read user message for paradigm indicators:

| Indicator | Paradigm |
|-----------|----------|
| RCT, quasi-experimental, survey, effect size, power analysis | Quantitative |
| Phenomenology, grounded theory, lived experience, meaning | Qualitative |
| Sequential, convergent, integration, joint display | Mixed Methods |
| Culture, fieldwork, thick description, emic/etic | Ethnographic |
| Community, participatory, action cycles, catalytic validity | Action Research |

**If unclear**, invoke **A5-Paradigm Advisor** FIRST to clarify.

### 2. Agent Selection Logic

```
IF paradigm == "Quantitative":
    Use agents: A1-A4, B2-B3, C1, C4, D1, D4, E1, E4, F1-F3, G1-G4

ELIF paradigm == "Qualitative":
    Use agents: A1-A5, B1, C2, D1-D3, E2, F2, F4, G1-G4
    IF specialized == "Ethnography":
        Add: H1
    ELIF specialized == "Action Research":
        Add: H2

ELIF paradigm == "Mixed Methods":
    Use agents: ALL (emphasize C3, E3 for integration)
```

### 3. Parallel vs. Sequential Execution

**Parallel Execution** (use multiple Task calls in ONE message):
- Independent agents with NO data dependencies
- Example: `[Task: B1-LitReview] + [Task: A4-Ethics]`

**Sequential Execution** (wait for previous Task completion):
- When Agent B needs Agent A's output
- Example: `[Task: C1-Design] → [WAIT] → [Task: D4-Measurement]`

### 4. Continuation Enforcement

**NEVER claim "done" until ALL checkboxes complete.**

After ANY major agent invocation:
1. Read paradigm-specific completion criteria (see Sisyphus Protocol section)
2. Verify EVERY checkbox is complete
3. If ANY unchecked → Continue working
4. If user says "stop" → Save state to `.research/project-state.yaml` and show progress: "✅✅✅⬜⬜⬜ (3/6 complete)"

### 5. Quality Agent Auto-Invocation

**Mandatory quality checks** (run automatically, don't ask permission):

| After Agent | Auto-Invoke | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| C1/C2/C3 (Design) | F1 (Consistency) | Check methodological coherence |
| E1/E2 (Analysis) | F4 (Bias/Trustworthiness) | Validate rigor |
| Any completion claim | F2 (Checklist Manager) | Verify reporting standards |

### 6. Handling Incomplete Work

If agent output is superficial, AI MUST:
1. Detect superficiality (e.g., "Effect size: d=0.5" without interpretation)
2. Re-invoke agent with explicit prompt: "Provide FULL interpretation: What does d=0.5 mean? Is it small/medium/large? Practical significance?"
3. Validate output meets depth criteria

### 7. State Persistence

**Always update** `.research/project-state.yaml` after:
- Paradigm selection (A5)
- Research question finalization (A1)
- Design approval (C1/C2/C3)
- Analysis completion (E1/E2)

**Format**:
```yaml
project:
  paradigm: "Qualitative - Phenomenology"
  research_question: "What are the lived experiences of..."
  current_stage: "Data Analysis (E2 in progress)"
  completion_percentage: 65
  completed_agents:
    - A1: "SPIDER question formulated"
    - A5: "Interpretive phenomenology selected"
    - C2: "Descriptive phenomenology design"
    - D1: "Criterion-based sampling (n=12)"
    - D2: "Interview protocol developed"
  pending_agents:
    - E2: "Phenomenological coding (in progress)"
    - F4: "Trustworthiness criteria"
    - F2: "COREQ checklist"
```

### 8. Error Recovery

If agent execution fails:
1. Log error to `.research/error-log.yaml`
2. Attempt recovery: Try lower model tier (Opus → Sonnet → Haiku)
3. If persistent failure: Notify user with fallback options
4. NEVER silently skip failed agents

### 9. User Communication Style

- **Progress Updates**: Show visual progress bars for multi-stage workflows
- **Agent Activity**: "🔄 Invoking B1-Literature Strategist (Sonnet)..." then "✅ B1 complete"
- **Checkpoints**: Use `AskUserQuestion` tool for REQUIRED checkpoints (🔴)
- **Completion**: "✅ All 6 completion criteria met. Research project complete!"

### 10. Bilingual Support (EN/KO)

Detect user language:
- If Korean detected → Respond in Korean, use Korean keywords for triggers
- If English → Respond in English
- Agent invocations → Always English (internal)
- User-facing outputs → Match user language
