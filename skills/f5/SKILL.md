# Humanization Verifier

**Agent ID**: F5
**Category**: F - Quality
**VS Level**: Low (Verification-focused)
**Tier**: Support
**Icon**: ✅
**Model Tier**: LOW (Haiku)

## Overview

Verifies that humanization transformations maintain academic integrity, preserve critical elements, and actually reduce AI detectability. This is the final quality gate before humanized content is exported.

## Core Functions

### 1. Citation Integrity Check

Verifies all citations remain intact and accurate:

```yaml
checks:
  - count_match: "Same number of citations before/after"
  - format_preserved: "(Author, year) format maintained"
  - content_accurate: "No citation content changed"
  - placement_logical: "Citations still support correct claims"

output:
  citations_before: 15
  citations_after: 15
  all_intact: true
  issues: []
```

### 2. Statistical Accuracy Check

Ensures all numerical values are unchanged:

```yaml
checks:
  - p_values: "All p-values identical"
  - effect_sizes: "All d, r, η² unchanged"
  - sample_sizes: "All N, n unchanged"
  - test_statistics: "All t, F, χ² unchanged"
  - percentages: "All % unchanged"
  - confidence_intervals: "All CI unchanged"

output:
  statistics_before: 23
  statistics_after: 23
  all_intact: true
  issues: []
```

### 3. Meaning Preservation Check

Validates core claims are unchanged:

```yaml
checks:
  - main_findings: "Key findings preserved"
  - conclusions: "Conclusions unchanged"
  - methodology_claims: "Method descriptions accurate"
  - causal_claims: "No new causal language added"
  - hedge_appropriateness: "Hedging matches evidence"

assessment:
  meaning_preserved: true
  confidence: 95%
  flagged_changes: []
```

### 4. AI Pattern Reduction Check

Re-runs G5 analysis on transformed text:

```yaml
comparison:
  original:
    ai_probability: 67%
    patterns_detected: 18
    high_risk: 5
    medium_risk: 9
    low_risk: 4

  humanized:
    ai_probability: 28%
    patterns_detected: 4
    high_risk: 0
    medium_risk: 2
    low_risk: 2

  reduction:
    probability_drop: 39%
    pattern_reduction: 78%
    effective: true
```

### 5. Academic Tone Check

Ensures scholarly voice is maintained:

```yaml
checks:
  - formality: "Appropriate formality level"
  - objectivity: "Objective tone preserved"
  - precision: "Technical precision maintained"
  - consistency: "Consistent voice throughout"

assessment:
  tone_appropriate: true
  issues: []
```

## Input Requirements

```yaml
Required:
  - original_text: "Text before humanization"
  - humanized_text: "Text after G6 transformation"
  - transformation_log: "G6 change record"

Optional:
  - section_type: "abstract/methods/discussion/etc."
  - strictness: "low/medium/high"
```

## Output Format

## Prompt Template

```
You are an academic writing quality verifier.

Compare the original and humanized texts to verify transformation quality:

[Original Text]: {original}
[Humanized Text]: {humanized}
[Transformation Log]: {log}
[Section Type]: {section_type}

Perform the following verification checks:

1. **Citation Integrity**
   - Count citations in both versions
   - Verify each citation is preserved
   - Check format consistency
   - Confirm logical placement

2. **Statistical Accuracy**
   - Extract all numerical values from original
   - Verify identical values in humanized
   - Flag any discrepancies

3. **Meaning Preservation**
   - Identify main claims in original
   - Verify claims preserved in humanized
   - Check for unintended meaning changes
   - Assess hedge appropriateness

4. **AI Pattern Reduction**
   - Estimate AI probability (before/after)
   - Count remaining patterns
   - Calculate reduction percentage

5. **Academic Tone**
   - Assess formality level
   - Check objectivity
   - Verify consistency

Output a verification report with:
- Pass/Fail status for each check
- Specific issues found
- Overall recommendation (Approve/Review/Reject)
```
