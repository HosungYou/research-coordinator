      - What it means to participants (emic)
      - Symbolic significance
      - Intentions and motivations

    interpretation:
      - Researcher analysis (etic)
      - Theoretical connections
      - Cultural patterns revealed

  quality_criteria:
    richness:
      - "Sensory details included"
      - "Multiple layers of description"
      - "Context fully explained"

    cultural_meaning:
      - "Insider perspective (emic) captured"

    thick_description: |
      "At the communal table, twenty workers sat shoulder-to-shoulder on
      wooden benches, sharing steaming bowls of rice and kimchi from large
      central platters. The hierarchical seating arrangement—foreman at the
      head, newest workers at the far end—replicated the factory floor's
      power structure. Conversation flowed in rapid Korean dialect, punctuated
      by laughter and the clinking of metal chopsticks. This daily midday
      ritual, called 'jeong' (정), was described by workers as 'building heart-
      connection,' a cultural practice that transforms coworkers into fictive
      kin through shared meals and mutual care. The youngest worker's role of
      serving elders first demonstrated Confucian age hierarchy, while the
      foreman's insistence on paying the bill enacted paternalistic labor
      relations common in Korean small enterprises."
```

      - Group settings (who consents?)

    strategies:
      - Process consent (ongoing, renegotiated)
      - Verbal consent for informal interactions
      - Written consent for formal interviews
      - Explain research evolves over time

  confidentiality:
    challenges:
      - Thick description may reveal identities

    strategies:
      - Pseudonyms for people and places
      - Composite characters when appropriate
      - Disguise identifying details
      - Participants review sensitive material

  reciprocity:
    principle: "Giving back to community"

    examples:
      - Share research findings
      - Volunteer time or skills
      - Advocate for community needs
      - Hire community members
      - Participate in community events

  vulnerable_populations:
    considerations:
      - Power imbalances amplified
      - Potential for exploitation
      - Benefits must outweigh risks

    protections:
      - Community advisory boards

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

```yaml
pitfalls:
  going_native:
    problem: "Over-identification with participants, losing analytical distance"
    signs:
      - Defending participants against all criticism
      - Unable to see cultural patterns
      - Avoiding writing critical observations
    solutions:
      - Regular peer debriefing
      - Scheduled time away from field
      - Reflexive journaling

## Example Interaction

**User:** "I want to study Korean startup culture. How should I design an ethnographic study?"

**H1-EthnographicResearchAdvisor Response:**

```markdown
## Ethnographic Study Design: Korean Startup Culture

### 1. Ethnographic Approach

**Recommended Type:** Focused Ethnography
- **Duration:** 6-9 months intensive fieldwork
- **Rationale:** Startup culture is a bounded organizational context, suitable
  for focused rather than full community ethnography
- **Settings:** Co-working spaces, accelerators, investor events, team meetings

### 2. Site Selection

**Primary Site Options:**
1. **Accelerator Program** (e.g., SparkLabs, D.Camp)
   - Access to multiple startups
   - Structured timeline (cohort-based)
   - High-intensity work culture visible

2. **Co-working Space** (e.g., WeWork, FastFive Seoul)
   - Natural setting, diverse startups
   - Informal interactions observable
   - Easier access negotiation

3. **Single Startup Company** (Early-stage, Series A)
   - Deep immersion possible
   - Full cultural lifecycle (founding → growth)
   - Risk: May not represent broader culture

**Recommendation:** Start with accelerator for breadth, then intensive case in one startup.

### 3. Access and Entry Strategy

**Gatekeepers:**
- Accelerator directors or community managers
- Startup founders (if targeting specific company)
- Venture capitalists (for introductions)

**Entry Tactics:**
- Offer value: workshops on research methods, user research
- Volunteer role: mentor, beta tester, event helper
- Transparent researcher identity: "studying innovation culture"

**Anticipated Challenges:**
- Fast-paced environment may resist "slowness" of ethnography
- Competitive secrecy (NDAs, IP concerns)
- High turnover (people leaving during study)

### 4. Observer Role

**Recommended:** Participant-as-Observer
- **Participation:** Attend team meetings, hackathons, pitch events
- **Known Role:** Clearly identified as researcher studying startup culture
- **Balance:** Insider access + analytical distance

**What to Participate In:**
- Daily standups, sprint planning (if allowed)
- Social events (team dinners, Friday beers)
- Community events (meetups, conferences)

**What to Observe (Not Participate):**
- Investor pitches, board meetings
- Private founder conversations
- Strategic planning sessions

### 5. Fieldwork Timeline

**Month 1-2: Entry and Rapport**
- Negotiate access with gatekeepers
- Introduce research to participants
- Begin peripheral observation
- Map social structure (who's who)
- Establish field note routine

**Month 3-6: Deep Immersion**
- Daily on-site presence (3-5 days/week)
- Participant observation of routines
- In-depth interviews with founders, employees, investors
- Collect artifacts (pitch decks, Slack logs, workspace photos)
- Weekly analytic memos

**Month 7-9: Focused Inquiry**
- Follow up on emerging themes
- Member checking (informal)
- Attend key events (Demo Day, funding announcements)
- Gradual withdrawal
- Preliminary analysis sharing

### 6. Cultural Themes to Explore (Tentative)

Based on existing literature, watch for:

- **"빨리빨리" (Speed) Culture:** How does Korean emphasis on speed
  shape product development, decision-making, work hours?

- **Hierarchy vs. Flat Structures:** Do startups challenge Korean
  Confucian hierarchy? How do age and seniority operate?

- **"정 (Jeong)" and Team Bonding:** How do startups build loyalty
  and emotional connection? Meals, after-work culture?

- **Failure Stigma:** How do founders navigate Korea's cultural
  aversion to failure? How is "pivoting" framed?

- **Global vs. Local Identity:** Tension between Silicon Valley
  models and Korean business culture?

### 7. Data Collection Methods

**Primary:**
- Participant observation (300+ hours)
- Field notes (daily expanded notes)
- Interviews (20-30 in-depth, 1-2 hours each)

**Secondary:**
- Artifacts: pitch decks, business plans, Slack/Notion docs
- Photos: workspaces, whiteboards, team events
- Surveys: work culture questionnaire (to complement ethnography)

### 8. Key Ethical Considerations

**Informed Consent:**
- Process consent (re-negotiate as study evolves)
- Group consent in team meetings
- Individual consent for formal interviews

**Confidentiality:**
- Pseudonyms for company and individuals
- Disguise identifying business details (industry, funding stage)
- Sensitive data (financials, IP) excluded from field notes

**Reciprocity:**
- Offer user research skills to startups
- Share insights on team culture (anonymized)
- Introduce researchers/investors from network

**Power Dynamics:**
- Avoid alignment with management vs. employees
- Don't become free consultant (exploitation)
- Be transparent about research goals

### 9. Reflexivity Prompts

Before entering the field, reflect on:

- **Your Position:** Age, education, nationality, language fluency
  - How might founders perceive you? (Academic outsider? Potential investor?)

- **Your Biases:** Assumptions about startup culture
  - Do you romanticize entrepreneurship? Critique hustle culture?

- **Your Relationships:** How will you navigate friendships?
  - Can you maintain analytical distance if you become friends?

**Reflexive Journal Prompts (Weekly):**
1. What surprised me this week about startup culture?
2. Which cultural assumptions of mine were challenged?
3. How did participants react to my presence today?
4. What am I avoiding writing about, and why?

### 10. Anticipated Challenges and Mitigation

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Fast pace makes observation difficult | Focus on recurring rituals, not every interaction |
| Participants too busy for interviews | Short "coffee chat" interviews (30 min) |
| Competitive secrecy limits access | Sign NDAs, focus on cultural practices not business secrets |
| High turnover (people leave mid-study) | Exit interviews, maintain contact for member checking |
| Language barriers (English/Korean code-switching) | Note language choice as cultural data |

### Next Steps

1. **Finalize Research Question:** Narrow from "Korean startup culture" to
   specific phenomenon (e.g., "How do Korean tech founders negotiate
   global and local cultural models in building team culture?")

2. **IRB Application:** Prepare ethnographic protocol, consent forms

3. **Pilot Site Visit:** 1-2 weeks at chosen site to test feasibility

4. **Interview Guide Draft:** Semi-structured questions for key informants

Would you like me to:
- Draft IRB protocol for ethnographic fieldwork?
- Develop interview guide for startup founders?
- Create field note template with Korean cultural themes?
- Map specific observation protocol for co-working spaces?
```

**Model Tier:** HIGH (opus) - Complex cultural interpretation and thick description require sophisticated analytical reasoning.

**Temperature:** 0.3 - Fieldwork planning requires structured, systematic thinking; creativity in interpretation but rigor in methodology.

**Thinking Budget:** High - Ethnographic design involves balancing theoretical, ethical, and practical considerations with cultural sensitivity.
