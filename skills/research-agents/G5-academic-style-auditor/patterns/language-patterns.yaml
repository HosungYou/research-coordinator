    name: "AI Vocabulary Clustering"
    risk_level: "high"
    description: |
      Certain words appear with dramatically higher frequency in AI-generated text.
      When multiple AI-typical words cluster together, detectability increases significantly.

    name: "Copula Avoidance"
    risk_level: "medium"
    description: |
      AI models avoid simple "is/are" constructions, substituting more complex alternatives.
      This creates unnecessarily elaborate sentence structures.

    indicators:
      avoidance_patterns:
        - "serves as"
        - "stands as"
        - "acts as"
        - "functions as"
        - "operates as"

        - "emerges as"
        - "remains as"
        - "appears as"
        - "positions itself as"

      # Verb substitutions for "is"
      verb_inflation:
        - "represents"    # when simple "is" works
        - "constitutes"   # when simple "is" works
        - "comprises"     # when simple "is" works
        - "embodies"      # almost always AI

        - "encompasses"
        - "harbors"

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "'Represents' for actual representation (figures, symbols)"
        - "'Comprises' for genuine composition"
        - "Technical precision requires specific verb"

    transformations:
      "serves as": "is"
      "stands as": "is"
      "functions as": "is"
      "acts as": "is"
      "boasts": "has"

  L3:
    name: "Negative Parallelism"
    risk_level: "medium"
    description: |
      Overuse of parallel negative constructions that feel algorithmic.
      AI favors these balanced structures for apparent sophistication.

    indicators:
      parallel_structures:
        - "not only... but also"
        - "It's not just... it's"
        - "not merely... but"
        - "neither... nor" (overused)
        - "both... and" (overused)
        - "whether... or"

      # Frequency matters
      threshold: 2  # 2+ uses in one document = flag

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Single use for genuine contrast"
        - "Rhetorical emphasis in introduction/conclusion"

      flag_when:
        - "Multiple instances in same document"
        - "Used for simple additions (not actual contrasts)"

    transformations:
      "not only X but also Y": "X and Y" (when parallel not needed)
      "It's not just X, it's Y": "Beyond X, Y" or "X, and also Y"

  L4:
    name: "Rule of Three"
    risk_level: "low"
    description: |
      AI forces ideas into groups of three for rhetorical effect.
      When two or four items would be more natural, three feels artificial.

    indicators:
      patterns:
        - "X, Y, and Z" (when only 2 points exist)
        - "three key aspects"
        - "three main findings"
        - "three implications"
        - "three contributions"

      # Check if third item is redundant or forced
      redundancy_signals:
        - Third item repeats first/second with different words
        - Third item is notably weaker than first two
        - Third item feels like filler

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Natural groupings of three"
        - "Established frameworks with three components"
        - "Three genuinely distinct points"

    transformations:
      note: "Consider if all three items are necessary; combine or remove redundant ones"

  L5:
    name: "Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)"
    risk_level: "medium"
    description: |
      AI rotates through synonyms within short passages to avoid repetition,
      but this creates unnatural lexical variation that humans don't use.

    indicators:
      cycling_patterns:
        # Same concept with different words in adjacent sentences
        - ["study", "research", "investigation", "inquiry"]
        - ["participants", "subjects", "respondents", "individuals"]
        - ["findings", "results", "outcomes", "conclusions"]
        - ["method", "approach", "technique", "procedure"]
        - ["effect", "impact", "influence", "consequence"]
        - ["important", "significant", "crucial", "essential"]
        - ["show", "demonstrate", "reveal", "indicate"]
        - ["suggest", "imply", "propose", "recommend"]

      # Detection: same concept, 3+ different words in 3 sentences
      threshold: 3  # variations of same concept

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Technical distinction exists (participants vs. subjects)"
        - "Style guide requires variation"
        - "Different aspects genuinely described"

      flag_when:
        - "Same referent called 3+ different names in short passage"
        - "Variation adds confusion rather than clarity"

    transformations:
      note: "Pick one term and use it consistently; variation should be meaningful"

  L6:
    name: "False Ranges"
    risk_level: "low"
    description: |
      AI constructs "from X to Y" phrases that don't represent actual ranges or spectrums.
      These create an illusion of comprehensiveness.

    indicators:
      patterns:
        - "from theory to practice"
        - "from local to global"
        - "from individual to organizational"
        - "from micro to macro"
        - "from novice to expert"
        - "from X to Y, from A to B"  # Double range = high AI

      # True ranges have measurable endpoints
      false_range_signals:
        - Endpoints are abstract concepts
        - Range doesn't represent actual variation in data
        - Used as filler rather than description

    academic_context:
      acceptable_when:
        - "Describing actual range in data (age: 18-65)"
        - "Established theoretical spectrum"
        - "Genuine continuum being discussed"

    transformations:
      "from theory to practice": "in both theoretical and practical terms"
      "from local to global": "at local and global levels"
      "from micro to macro": "at multiple levels of analysis"
