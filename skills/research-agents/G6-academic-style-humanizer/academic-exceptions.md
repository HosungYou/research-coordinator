# Academic Exceptions Guide

## Overview

This document defines what must NEVER be transformed during humanization, regardless of mode. Academic integrity requires preserving certain elements exactly as written.

---

## Absolute Preservation Rules

### 1. Citations and References

**NEVER transform:**

```
✅ PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- (Author, year) references
- Author et al. (year) citations
- Numbered citations [1], [2]
- Footnote references
- DOI identifiers
- URLs to sources
- Page numbers (p. 45, pp. 120-125)
```

**Examples:**
```
KEEP: "According to Bandura (1986), self-efficacy..."
KEEP: "Previous research (Smith et al., 2020; Jones, 2019) found..."
KEEP: "As noted in [1], [2], and [3]..."
```

---

### 2. Statistical Values

**NEVER transform:**

```
✅ PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- p-values: p < .05, p = .001
- Effect sizes: d = 0.8, r = .45, η² = .12
- Confidence intervals: 95% CI [0.5, 1.2]
- Sample sizes: N = 150, n = 45
- Means and SDs: M = 3.45, SD = 1.2
- Test statistics: t(48) = 2.34, F(2, 97) = 4.56
- Percentages with data: 67.3%
- Correlations: r = .45, p < .001
- Beta weights: β = .34
- Odds ratios: OR = 2.5
```

**Examples:**
```
KEEP: "Results were significant, t(148) = 3.45, p < .001, d = 0.56"
KEEP: "The model explained 45% of variance, R² = .45, F(3, 196) = 53.2"
KEEP: "A chi-square test revealed significant differences, χ²(2) = 12.45, p = .002"
```

---

### 3. Methodology Specifics

**NEVER transform:**

```
✅ PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- Instrument names: "Beck Depression Inventory-II"
- Software versions: "SPSS 28.0", "R version 4.2.1"
- Package names: "metafor package", "lavaan"
- Scale anchors: "1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree"
- Reliability values: α = .87, ω = .91
- Factor loadings: λ = .72
- Validity coefficients
- Sampling procedures (specific numbers)
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria (exact wording)
```

**Examples:**
```
KEEP: "We used the Self-Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995)"
KEEP: "Data were analyzed using Mplus 8.4 with MLR estimation"
KEEP: "Internal consistency was acceptable (α = .82)"
```

---

### 4. Direct Quotations

**NEVER transform:**

```
✅ PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- Any text in quotation marks from sources
- Block quotes
- Interview excerpts
- Participant statements
- Definitions from cited sources
```

**Examples:**
```
KEEP: Smith (2020) defined self-regulation as "the process by which..."
KEEP: As Participant 7 stated: "I felt overwhelmed by the workload"
KEEP: The APA (2020) guidelines note that "researchers should..."
```

### 5. Technical Terminology

**Context-Dependent Preservation:**

| Term | Preserve When | May Transform When |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| "significant" | With p-value | Casual usage |
| "robust" | Statistical robustness | General "strong" |
| "reliable" | Psychometric context | General usage |
| "valid" | Validity evidence | Casual "good" |
| "framework" | Named framework | Generic usage |
| "paradigm" | Philosophy of science | Casual "approach" |
| "construct" | Psychometric context | Casual "idea" |

**Field-Specific Terms to Preserve:**

```
✅ ALWAYS PRESERVE:
- Named theories: "Social Cognitive Theory", "TAM"
- Named frameworks: "TPACK", "SAMR model"
- Named methodologies: "Grounded Theory", "IPA"
- Named measures: "Likert scale", "Cronbach's alpha"
- Named analyses: "ANOVA", "regression", "SEM"
- Discipline-specific jargon (when appropriate)
```

---

### 6. Proper Nouns

**NEVER transform:**

```
✅ PRESERVE EXACTLY:
- Author names
- Institution names
- Organization names
- Journal names
- Conference names
- Database names
- Software names
- Study names/titles
- Geographic locations
```

---

### 7. Acronyms and Abbreviations

**Rules:**

```
✅ PRESERVE:
- Defined acronyms and their definitions
- Standard abbreviations (e.g., i.e., etc.)
- Field-standard acronyms (RCT, IRB, SEM)

May adjust:
- Full form vs. acronym choice (consistency)
- First-mention definitions (keep definition, may rephrase intro)
```

---

## Section-Specific Exceptions

### Abstract

**Extra caution with:**
- Word limits (changes may affect count)
- Required structure (IMRAD)
- Keywords (preserve exactly)

### Methods

**Higher tolerance for:**
- Passive voice (standard in many fields)
- Technical boilerplate (acceptable)
- Step-by-step descriptions

**Still preserve:**
- All numbers
- All instrument names
- All procedure specifics

### Results

**Preserve:**
- All statistics (absolutely)
- Table/figure references
- Specific finding statements

**May transform:**
- Interpretive framing
- Transition phrases

### Discussion

**May transform:**
- Interpretive language
- Speculative hedging
- Implication statements

**Preserve:**
- Specific limitations with numbers
- Direct references to results
- Citations

## Red Lines: What Makes Humanization Unethical

### DO NOT:

1. **Fabricate citations**
   - Never add fake citations to fix C5 (vague attributions)
   - Mark as [citation needed] instead

2. **Alter statistics**
   - Never round, adjust, or "improve" numbers
   - Never change significance levels

3. **Change methodology claims**
   - Never alter what was actually done
   - Never change sample sizes or procedures

4. **Remove genuine limitations**
   - Keep all honest limitations
   - Only rephrase, don't delete

5. **Misrepresent findings**
   - Transformation should not change what was found
   - Only how findings are expressed

---

## Context-Aware Exceptions

### When "AI Words" Are Appropriate

| Word | Appropriate Context | Transform In |
|------|---------------------|--------------|
| "landscape" | "research landscape review" | General usage |
| "framework" | Named theoretical framework | Vague usage |
| "significant" | Statistical significance | "Very important" |
| "robust" | "Robust standard errors" | "Strong" |
| "novel" | Genuinely first study | Marketing claims |
| "innovative" | Documented innovation | Self-promotion |

### Journal Style Requirements

Some journals require patterns we might flag:
- Passive voice ("It was found that...")
- Specific heading capitalization
- Certain transition phrases
- Structured abstract format

**Rule:** Check target journal; exempt required patterns.

---

## Transformation vs. Flagging

When unsure whether to transform:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Critical element (stats, citation) | PRESERVE |
| Technical term in context | PRESERVE |
| Unclear if appropriate | FLAG for author |
| Journal may require | FLAG with note |
| Definitely AI pattern | TRANSFORM |

---

## Audit Trail Requirements

For every humanization, document:

1. **What was preserved**
   - List all citations
   - List all statistics
   - List all technical terms kept

2. **What was transformed**
   - Before/after for each change
   - Pattern ID for each change
   - Justification

3. **What was flagged**
   - Items needing author decision
   - Citation gaps marked
   - Style questions raised

---

## Version Control

When humanizing:

1. Keep original version
2. Create clearly labeled humanized version
3. Maintain diff record
4. Enable easy revert

---

## Ethical Reminder

Humanization helps researchers express ideas naturally.
It does NOT:
- Make AI-written content "undetectable"
- Replace the need for AI disclosure
- Substitute for original thinking
- Justify academic dishonesty

The researcher remains responsible for:
- All claims and citations
- AI use disclosure
- Academic integrity
- Original contribution
