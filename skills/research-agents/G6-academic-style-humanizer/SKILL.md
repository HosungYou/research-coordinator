# Academic Style Humanizer

**Agent ID**: G6
**Category**: G - Communication
**VS Level**: High (Creative transformation)
**Tier**: Core
**Icon**: ✍️
**Model Tier**: HIGH (Opus)

## Overview

Transforms AI-generated academic text into natural, human-sounding prose while preserving:
- Academic integrity and scholarly tone
- Citation accuracy
- Statistical precision
- Methodological clarity
- Meaning and intent

This agent takes the analysis from G5-AcademicStyleAuditor and applies appropriate transformations based on user-selected mode.

## Core Philosophy

> "Humanization is not deception—it's translation from statistical average to authentic expression."

The goal is to help researchers express their ideas naturally, not to hide AI assistance. Transparency about AI use remains the user's ethical responsibility.

## Transformation Modes

### Conservative Mode
- **Target**: High-risk patterns only
- **Approach**: Minimal changes, maximum preservation
- **Best for**: Journal submissions, formal documents
- **Changes**: ~10-20% of flagged instances

### Balanced Mode (Recommended)
- **Target**: High and medium-risk patterns
- **Approach**: Natural flow with scholarly tone
- **Best for**: Most academic writing
- **Changes**: ~40-60% of flagged instances

### Aggressive Mode
- **Target**: All flagged patterns
- **Approach**: Maximum naturalness
- **Best for**: Blog posts, informal writing
- **Changes**: ~80-100% of flagged instances

## Input Requirements

```yaml
Required:
  - text: "Original text to humanize"
  - analysis: "G5 pattern analysis report"

Optional:
  - mode: "conservative/balanced/aggressive"
  - preserve_list: ["terms to keep unchanged"]
  - section_type: "abstract/methods/discussion/etc."
  - target_journal: "Journal style to consider"
```

## Transformation Principles

### 1. Preserve Critical Elements

**NEVER Transform:**
- Citations and references (Author, year)
- Statistical values (p < .05, d = 0.8)
- Sample sizes (N = 150)
- Methodology specifics (validated instruments)
- Direct quotes from sources
- Technical terms defined in the field
- Acronyms and their definitions

### 2. Maintain Academic Tone

**Balance:**
- Formal but not stilted
- Precise but not robotic
- Confident but not arrogant
- Hedged appropriately but not excessively

### 3. Transformation Hierarchy

1. **Vocabulary substitution** (safest)
   - Replace AI-typical words with natural alternatives

2. **Phrase restructuring** (moderate)
   - Rewrite verbose/formulaic phrases

3. **Sentence recombination** (careful)
   - Merge or split sentences for flow

4. **Paragraph reorganization** (rare)
   - Only when structure is clearly artificial

## Transformation Rules by Pattern

### Content Patterns (C1-C6)

## HAVS: Humanization-Adapted VS

HAVS (Humanization-Adapted VS) is a specialized 3-phase approach designed specifically for text transformation, distinct from the standard VS 5-phase methodology used for research decision-making.

### Why HAVS Instead of Standard VS?

| Aspect | Standard VS (Research) | HAVS (Humanization) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | Theory/methodology selection | Text transformation strategy |
| **T-Score Meaning** | Theory typicality | Transformation pattern typicality |
| **Phase Count** | 5 phases (0-5) | 3 phases (0-2) |
| **Creativity Focus** | Conceptual innovation | Natural expression |

> **Key Insight**: Standard VS is designed for research decision-making (choosing theories, methodologies). HAVS adapts the core anti-modal principle specifically for text transformation.

### HAVS Phase 0: Transformation Context

Before any transformation, collect contextual information:

```yaml
phase_0_inputs:
  g5_analysis:
    description: "Pattern analysis from G5-AcademicStyleAuditor"
    required: true
    includes:
      - pattern_categories: "C, L, S, M, H classifications"
      - risk_levels: "high/medium/low per pattern"
      - density_map: "Pattern distribution across text"

  target_style:
    description: "Desired output characteristics"
    options:
      - journal: "Formal academic journal style"
      - conference: "Conference paper style"
      - thesis: "Dissertation style"
      - informal: "Blog/commentary style"

  user_mode:
    description: "Transformation aggressiveness"
    options:
      - conservative: "High-risk patterns only"
      - balanced: "High + medium-risk (recommended)"
      - aggressive: "All patterns"
```

### HAVS Phase 1: Modal Transformation Warning

⚠️ **MODAL TRANSFORMATIONS (T > 0.7) - AVOID THESE**

Most humanization tools apply predictable transformations that AI detectors easily identify. HAVS explicitly warns against these modal approaches:

| Modal Transformation | T-Score | Why It Fails |
|---------------------|---------|--------------|
| **Synonym-only replacement** | 0.9 | Most common approach; AI detectors trained to spot it |
| **Sentence reordering only** | 0.85 | Structure preserved; patterns remain detectable |
| **Passive↔Active only** | 0.8 | Inconsistent voice creates new patterns |
| **Thesaurus cycling** | 0.85 | Unnatural word choices; semantic drift |
| **Paragraph shuffling** | 0.75 | Logical flow disrupted; easy to detect |

```yaml
modal_warning_system:
  threshold: 0.7

  warning_template: |
    ⚠️ MODAL TRANSFORMATION DETECTED (T = {t_score})

    This approach ({transformation_name}) is used by {percentage}% of
    humanization tools, making it predictable and detectable.

    Consider Direction B or C below for better differentiation.

  auto_block:
    enabled: false  # Warning only, user decides
    reason: "Humanization requires user judgment on risk tolerance"
```

### HAVS Phase 2: Differentiated Transformation Directions

After identifying patterns and warning about modal approaches, HAVS presents three differentiated transformation directions:

### 🟡 CHECKPOINT: CP_HAVS_DIRECTION

After presenting the analysis and directions, pause for user selection:

```markdown
---
### 🟡 CHECKPOINT: CP_HAVS_DIRECTION

Based on the G5 analysis showing {pattern_count} patterns ({high_count} high-risk,
{medium_count} medium-risk), select your transformation direction:

**[A] Direction A** (Conservative, T ≈ 0.6)
   - Vocabulary + phrase changes only
   - Best for: Strict journal requirements
   - Preserves: Document structure

**[B] Direction B** (Balanced, T ≈ 0.4) ⭐ Recommended
   - + Sentence recombination + flow improvements
   - Best for: Most academic writing
   - Preserves: Core meaning and citations

**[C] Direction C** (Aggressive, T ≈ 0.2)
   - + Paragraph reorganization + style transfer
   - Best for: Informal writing
   - ⚠️ Requires careful meaning verification

**[D] Custom** - Specify custom strategies
---
```

### HAVS Iterative Refinement

For Balanced (B) and Aggressive (C) modes, HAVS applies iterative refinement using the `iterative-loop` module:

```yaml
iterative_humanization:
  enabled: true
  trigger: "balanced or aggressive mode"
  max_iterations: 2

  iteration_1:
    action: "Apply primary transformation strategies"
    output: "First-pass humanized text"

  self_check:
    action: "Analyze transformed text for new AI patterns"
    criteria:
      - "No new AI patterns introduced by transformation"
      - "Meaning preserved (semantic similarity > 0.95)"
      - "Citations intact (100% preservation)"
      - "Statistics unchanged (100% preservation)"

  iteration_2:
    trigger: "self_check finds issues"
    action: "Remove self-generated AI patterns"
    output: "Refined humanized text"

  termination:
    conditions:
      - "max_iterations reached"
      - "self_check passes all criteria"
      - "no improvement from previous iteration"
```

### HAVS + Humanization Modules

HAVS integrates with two specialized humanization modules:

#### h-style-transfer Module

Applies discipline-specific writing styles:

```yaml
h_style_transfer:
  enabled_for: ["direction_b", "direction_c"]

  profiles:
    education:
      characteristics:
        - "Practice-oriented language"
        - "Explicit implications"
        - "Accessible terminology"
      avoid:
        - "Excessive abstraction"
        - "Overly technical jargon"

    psychology:
      characteristics:
        - "Person-centered framing"
        - "Measurement specificity"
        - "Careful hedging"
      avoid:
        - "Overgeneralization"
        - "Unqualified claims"

    management:
      characteristics:
        - "Action-oriented recommendations"
        - "Case-based examples"
        - "Practical implications"
      avoid:
        - "Pure theory without application"
        - "Vague recommendations"
```

#### h-flow-optimizer Module

Optimizes paragraph and sentence flow:

```yaml
h_flow_optimizer:
  enabled_for: ["direction_b", "direction_c"]

  strategies:
    sentence_level:
      - "Vary sentence length (short-medium-long patterns)"
      - "Balance simple and complex structures"
      - "Natural transition placement"

    paragraph_level:
      - "Topic sentence clarity"
      - "Evidence-analysis-synthesis flow"
      - "Cohesive device variation"

    document_level:
      - "Section balance"
      - "Argument progression"
      - "Conclusion echo of introduction"
```

### Verification Integration

After HAVS transformation, the result flows to F5-HumanizationVerifier:

```
G5 Analysis → G6 HAVS Transformation → CP_HUMANIZATION_VERIFICATION → F5 Verification

## Prompt Template

```
You are an academic writing specialist transforming AI-generated text into natural prose.

Apply the following transformations to the text:

[Original Text]: {text}
[G5 Analysis]: {analysis}
[Mode]: {mode}  # conservative/balanced/aggressive
[Section Type]: {section_type}

Transformation Rules:

1. **PRESERVE ABSOLUTELY**:
   - All citations (Author, year)
   - All statistics (p, d, N, etc.)
   - All methodology specifics
   - Direct quotes
   - Technical terms

2. **TRANSFORM** (based on mode):
   - AI vocabulary → natural alternatives
   - Verbose phrases → concise versions
   - Excessive hedging → appropriate qualification
   - Promotional language → neutral claims
   - Template structures → natural flow

3. **MAINTAIN**:
   - Academic formality
   - Scholarly tone
   - Logical flow
   - Original meaning

4. **OUTPUT**:
   - Transformed text
   - Change log (before/after for each)
   - Verification that meaning is preserved
   - New AI probability estimate

Mode-specific behavior:
- Conservative: Only high-risk patterns (C1, C4, C5, L1-tier1, M1, M2)
- Balanced: High + medium-risk patterns
- Aggressive: All patterns

After transformation, verify:
- All citations intact
- All statistics intact
- No meaning distortion
- Natural reading flow
```
