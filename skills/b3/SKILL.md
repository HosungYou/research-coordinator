# Effect Size Extractor

**Agent ID**: 07
**Category**: B - Literature & Evidence
**VS Level**: Enhanced (3-Phase)
**Tier**: Support
**Icon**: 📊

## Overview

Converts various forms of statistics from research papers into standardized effect sizes.
Accurately calculates effect sizes and variances/standard errors needed for meta-analysis.

**VS-Research methodology** is applied to go beyond simple formula application and provide
effect size strategies optimized for research design and meta-analysis purposes.

## VS-Research 3-Phase Process (Enhanced)

### Phase 1: Identify Modal Effect Size Approaches

**Purpose**: Recognize limitations of simple formula application

```markdown
⚠️ **Modal Warning**: These are the most predictable effect size extraction approaches:

| Modal Approach | T-Score | Limitations |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| "Apply t → d formula" | 0.90 | Ignores design specificity |
| "Standardize to Cohen's d" | 0.88 | May not be optimal scale |
| "Reverse calculate p → t when missing" | 0.85 | Information loss, increased uncertainty |

➡️ Formula application is baseline. Exploring optimal effect size strategy.
```

### Phase 2: Context-Optimal Effect Size Strategy

**Purpose**: Effect size strategy matched to research design and meta-analysis purpose

```markdown
**Direction A** (T ≈ 0.7): Standard Conversion + Design Correction
- Standard formulas + Hedges' g correction
- Matched/repeated measures design correction
- Suitable for: General meta-analyses

**Direction B** (T ≈ 0.4): Purpose-Specific Scales
- Select optimal scale by meta-analysis type
- Consider clustered/multilevel designs
- Dependency handling strategies
- Suitable for: Complex designs, education/psychology research

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Information Maximization Strategy
- Multiple estimation methods from incomplete reporting
- Bayesian effect size estimation
- Uncertainty propagation analysis
- Suitable for: Methodological research, precision meta-analysis
```

### Phase 4: Execute Recommendation

**Based on selected effect size strategy**:
1. Rationale for optimal scale selection
2. Conversion formulas and calculation process
3. Variance/SE calculations
4. Meta-analysis data format

## Conversion Formula Library

### Basic Effect Size Calculations

**Cohen's d (Independent Groups)**
```
d = (M₁ - M₂) / SD_pooled

SD_pooled = √[((n₁-1)SD₁² + (n₂-1)SD₂²) / (n₁ + n₂ - 2)]
```

**Hedges' g (Small Sample Correction)**
```
g = d × J

J = 1 - 3/(4(n₁ + n₂) - 9)
```

**Cohen's d (Matched Groups)**
```
d = M_diff / SD_diff

or

d = (M_pre - M_post) / SD_pooled × √(2(1-r))
```

### Conversion Formulas

**t → d**
```
d = t × √(1/n₁ + 1/n₂)
```

**F → d (2 groups)**
```
d = √(F × (n₁ + n₂) / (n₁ × n₂))
```

**r → d**
```
d = 2r / √(1 - r²)
```

**d → r**
```
r = d / √(d² + 4)
```

**OR → d**
```
d = ln(OR) × √3 / π
```

**η² → d**
```
d = 2 × √(η² / (1 - η²))
```

**r → Fisher's z**
```
z = 0.5 × ln[(1 + r) / (1 - r)]
```

### Variance Calculations

**Variance of d**
```
V_d = (n₁ + n₂)/(n₁ × n₂) + d²/(2(n₁ + n₂))
```

**Variance of r**
```
V_r = (1 - r²)² / (n - 1)
```

**Variance of Fisher's z**
```
V_z = 1 / (n - 3)
```

## Effect Size Selection Hierarchy (V7 Lesson)

### Mandatory Selection Rules

When a study reports multiple statistics, apply this hierarchy:

| Priority | Type | Formula | Use When |
|----------|------|---------|----------|
| **1 (Best)** | Post-test between-groups | d = (M_post_T - M_post_C) / SD_pooled | Control group exists |
| **2** | ANCOVA-adjusted | Use adjusted means | Pre-test as covariate |
| **3** | Change score | d = (delta_M_T - delta_M_C) / SD_pooled_change | No between-group post |
| **4 (Last)** | Single-group pre-post | d = (M_post - M_pre) / SD_pre | No control group |

### NEVER Include

- Pre-test scores as independent outcomes
- Baseline equivalence checks (these verify, not measure effect)
- Multiple timepoints without 3-level modeling

### Human Checkpoint: CP_ES_HIERARCHY

**Trigger**: Study has >1 potential effect size

**Required Decision**:
1. Which ES best represents treatment effect?
2. Rationale for selection
3. How to handle excluded ES (document or sensitivity analysis)

### Pre-test Exclusion Patterns

```python
EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = [
    r'pre[- ]?test', r'pretest', r'baseline',
    r'pre[- ]?intervention', r'pre[- ]?training',
    r'time\s*1', r'T1(?!\d)', r'before\s+treatment'
]
```

### Cohen's d to Hedges' g Verification

**ALWAYS verify the conversion:**

```python
def verify_hedges_g(d, n1, n2):
    df = n1 + n2 - 2
    J = 1 - (3 / (4 * df - 1))
    g = d * J
    SE_g = sqrt((n1 + n2) / (n1 * n2) + g**2 / (2 * (n1 + n2)))
    return {'g': g, 'SE': SE_g, 'J': J}
```

**Tolerance**: |calculated_g - reported_g| < 0.01
