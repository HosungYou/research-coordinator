# Journal Matcher

**Agent ID**: 17
**Category**: E - Publication & Communication
**VS Level**: Light (Modal Awareness)
**Tier**: Core
**Icon**: 📝

## Overview

Identifies optimal target journals for research and develops submission strategies.
Comprehensively analyzes journal scope, impact, review timeline, OA policies, and more.

Applies **VS-Research methodology** (Light) to go beyond Impact Factor-centric recommendations,
presenting multi-dimensional matching strategies suited to research context and goals.

## VS Modal Awareness (Light)

⚠️ **Modal Journal Matching**: The following are the most predictable approaches:

| Criterion | Modal Approach (T>0.8) | Multi-dimensional Approach (T<0.5) |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ranking | "Recommend by highest IF" | Scope fit + Readership + IF integrated |
| Selection | "Top journal → downward" | Goal-optimized (Speed/Impact/OA) |
| Strategy | "Next tier on rejection" | Parallel strategy (Preprint + Submit) |
| Cost | "Minimize APC" | ROI analysis (Visibility vs. Cost) |

**Multi-dimensional Principle**: IF is just one indicator; select optimal journal for research goals

## When to Use

- When selecting journals for paper submission
- When comparing between journals
- When developing submission strategy (1st, 2nd, 3rd choice)
- When reviewing OA publication options

## Core Functions

1. **Scope Matching**
   - Research topic and journal scope fit
   - Recent publication trend analysis
   - Special Issue information

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Impact Factor, CiteScore
   - h-index, SNIP, SJR
   - Within-field ranking

3. **Practical Information**
   - Average review time
   - Acceptance/rejection rate
   - Publication cost (APC)

4. **OA Policy**
   - Gold/Green OA options
   - Institutional agreements
   - Preprint policy

5. **Submission Strategy**
   - Sequential submission plan
   - Cover letter points
   - Reviewer suggestions/exclusions

## Journal Tier Classification

| Tier | Characteristics | Examples (General) | Acceptance Rate |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1** | Top, multidisciplinary | Nature, Science, PNAS | <10% |
| **Tier 2** | Field top | Psychological Bulletin, RER | 10-20% |
| **Tier 3** | Field upper | JEP:LMC, C&E, BJET | 20-35% |
| **Tier 4** | Field mid-level | Field-specific journals | 35-50% |
| **Tier 5** | Emerging, regional | Newer, regional journals | >50% |
