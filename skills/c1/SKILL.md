## VS-Research 3-Phase Process (Enhanced)

### Phase 1: Modal Research Design Identification

**Purpose**: Explicitly identify the most predictable "obvious" designs

```markdown
⚠️ **Modal Warning**: The following are the most predictable designs for [research type]:

| Modal Design | T-Score | Limitation |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| "Pretest-posttest control group design" | 0.90 | Overused, attrition issues |
| "Cross-sectional survey" | 0.88 | Cannot establish causation |
| "Single-site RCT" | 0.85 | Limited external validity |

➡️ This is baseline. Exploring context-optimal designs.
```

### Phase 2: Alternative Design Options

**Purpose**: Present differentiated design options based on T-Score

```markdown
**Direction A** (T ≈ 0.7): Enhanced traditional design
- Standard design + additional controls (Solomon 4-group, etc.)
- Suitable for: When internal validity strengthening needed

**Direction B** (T ≈ 0.4): Innovative design
- Interrupted Time Series
- Regression Discontinuity
- Multilevel design
- Suitable for: Randomization impossible, natural experiment situations

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Cutting-edge methodology
- Adaptive Trial Designs
- SMART (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial)
- Platform Trials
- Suitable for: Complex interventions, personalized research
```

### Phase 4: Recommendation Execution

For **selected design**:
1. Design structure diagram
2. Validity threats and control strategies
3. Sample size calculation
4. Specific implementation timeline

  - Local treatment effect well-identified

weaknesses:
  - Requires large sample size (especially near cutoff)
  - Limited generalization (only at cutoff)
  - Sensitive to functional form misspecification
  - Cannot estimate average treatment effect

when_to_use:
  - Assignment rule involves cutoff
  - Random assignment unethical/infeasible
  - Sufficient observations near cutoff

typical_applications:
  - Scholarship eligibility (test score cutoff)
  - Remedial program assignment
  - Grade promotion policies
  - Merit-based program evaluation

design_considerations:
  - Ensure sufficient bandwidth around cutoff
  - Check for manipulation of assignment variable
  - Test sensitivity to functional form
  - Plot raw data to visualize discontinuity

### 2. Survey Designs

**Cross-Sectional Survey**
```yaml
structure:
  components:
    - Single time point data collection
    - Representative or convenience sample
    - Measure multiple variables simultaneously

strengths:
  - Cost-effective and efficient
  - Large sample sizes feasible
  - Wide population coverage
  - Snapshot of current state

weaknesses:
  - Cannot establish temporal precedence
  - Limited causal inference
  - Common method bias
  - Response rate issues

when_to_use:
  - Describe population characteristics
  - Explore variable relationships
  - Hypothesis generation
  - Limited time/resources

typical_applications:
  - Public opinion surveys
  - Needs assessment
  - Correlational research
  - Market research
```

**Longitudinal Panel Study**
```yaml
structure:
  components:
    - Same participants measured repeatedly
    - Multiple waves (2+ time points)
    - Track individual change

strengths:
  - Individual change trajectories
  - Temporal precedence established
  - Within-person comparisons
  - Stronger causal inference than cross-sectional

weaknesses:
  - Attrition threatens validity
  - Long duration and cost
  - Practice effects
  - Cohort effects confounded with age

when_to_use:
  - Individual development/change
  - Causal relationships over time
  - Predictive models

typical_applications:
  - Career development studies
  - Academic achievement trajectories
  - Health behavior change
  - Technology adoption over time

attrition_mitigation:
  - Incentives for continued participation
  - Multiple contact methods
  - Intention-to-treat analysis
  - Attrition analysis (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
```

**Survey Experiments**
```yaml
vignette_studies:
  description: "Embedded experiments in surveys using hypothetical scenarios"
  structure:
    - Participants randomly assigned to vignette conditions
    - Vignette attributes manipulated
    - Measure responses to scenarios
  strengths:
    - Causal inference + generalizability
    - Control over stimuli
    - Large samples (online surveys)
  weaknesses:
    - Hypothetical scenarios (external validity)
    - Social desirability bias
    - Cognitive burden

conjoint_analysis:
  description: "Choice experiments with multiple attributes"
  structure:
    - Participants evaluate profiles with varying attributes
    - Estimate attribute importance
    - Forced choice or rating tasks
  strengths:
    - Realistic decision contexts
    - Interaction effects
    - Policy simulations
  weaknesses:
    - Complex design and analysis
    - Assumes compensatory decision-making
    - Interpretation challenges
```

**Effect Size Conventions**
```yaml
cohens_d:
  small: 0.2
  medium: 0.5
  large: 0.8
  interpretation: "Standardized mean difference (t-tests)"
  formula: "(M₁ - M₂) / SD_pooled"

cohens_f:
  small: 0.10
  medium: 0.25
  large: 0.40
  interpretation: "Effect size for ANOVA"
  relation_to_eta_squared: "f = √(η² / (1 - η²))"

eta_squared:
  small: 0.01
  medium: 0.06
  large: 0.14
  interpretation: "Proportion of variance explained"
  note: "η² = SS_effect / SS_total"

correlation_r:
  small: 0.10
  medium: 0.30
  large: 0.50

odds_ratio:
  small: 1.5
