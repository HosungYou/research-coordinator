## VS-Research 3-Phase Process (Enhanced)

### Phase 1: Modal Research Design Identification

**Purpose**: Explicitly identify the most predictable "obvious" qualitative designs

```markdown
⚠️ **Modal Warning**: The following are the most predictable designs for [research type]:

| Modal Design | T-Score | Limitation |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| "Descriptive phenomenology (Husserl)" | 0.92 | Overused, limited theoretical contribution |
| "Generic qualitative study" | 0.88 | Lacks methodological rigor |
| "Single-case study (convenience)" | 0.85 | Limited transferability |

➡️ This is baseline. Exploring context-optimal designs.
```

### Phase 2: Alternative Design Options

**Purpose**: Present differentiated design options based on T-Score

```markdown
**Direction A** (T ≈ 0.7): Enhanced traditional design
- Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)
- Multi-site case study with replication logic
- Suitable for: When established methodology preferred

**Direction B** (T ≈ 0.4): Innovative design
- Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz)
- Embedded case study with mixed methods
- Discourse analysis with critical lens
- Suitable for: Theory-building, complex phenomena

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Cutting-edge methodology
- Photo-elicitation phenomenology
- Collaborative action research
- Digital ethnography (netnography)
- Suitable for: Novel contexts, underexplored populations
```

### Phase 3: Recommendation Execution

For **selected design**:
1. Design structure and philosophical assumptions
2. Quality criteria (credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability)
3. Participant selection strategy and sample size justification
4. Specific data collection and analysis procedures

## Sample Size Guidelines

```yaml
Phenomenology:
  descriptive_phenomenology: "5-25 participants (typical: 10-15)"
  hermeneutic_phenomenology: "5-25 participants"
  IPA: "3-6 participants (focus on depth, idiographic analysis)"
  rationale: "Small sample allows deep, rich description of lived experience"

Grounded_Theory:
  systematic: "20-30 participants (or until theoretical saturation)"
  constructivist: "20-30 participants"
  classic: "Varies widely, until theoretical saturation"
  rationale: "Larger sample needed for theory development, saturation of categories"

Case_Study:
  single_case: "1 case (with multiple data sources)"
  multiple_case_literal: "2-3 cases (literal replication)"
  multiple_case_theoretical: "4-6 cases (theoretical replication)"
  embedded: "1 case with multiple sub-units"
  rationale: "Number of cases depends on replication logic, not statistical logic"

Narrative_Inquiry:
  biographical: "1-3 participants (deep dive into individual stories)"
  life_history: "1-10 participants"
  oral_history: "5-15 participants"
  rationale: "Small sample for in-depth narrative analysis"

Ethnography:
  classic: "1 cultural group (prolonged immersion)"
  focused: "1 setting/group (shorter duration)"
  netnography: "1 online community (archival + participant observation)"
  rationale: "Focus on cultural understanding, not sample size"

Saturation_Criteria:
  data_saturation: "No new information emerges from additional participants"
  theoretical_saturation: "No new categories or properties emerge (grounded theory)"
  informational_redundancy: "Themes repeat, no new insights"
```

## Quality Criteria (Lincoln & Guba, 1985)

```yaml
Credibility:
  strategies:
    - Prolonged engagement (sufficient time in field)
    - Persistent observation (identify salient characteristics)
    - Triangulation (data source, method, investigator, theory)
    - Peer debriefing (external check with disinterested peer)
    - Negative case analysis (search for disconfirming evidence)
    - Member checking (verify interpretations with participants)

Transferability:
  strategies:
    - Thick description (detailed, contextual description)
    - Purposive sampling (maximum variation, rich information)
    - Contextual details (setting, participants, time period)
  note: "Reader determines applicability to other contexts"

Dependability:
  strategies:
    - Audit trail (detailed documentation of research process)
    - Reflexive journal (researcher's reflections, decisions)
    - External audit (independent review of process)
    - Clear decision-making documentation

Confirmability:
  strategies:
    - Audit trail (link data to interpretations)
    - Reflexivity statement (researcher biases, assumptions)
    - Bracketing (phenomenology: suspend assumptions)
    - Triangulation (multiple sources/methods confirm findings)
  note: "Findings reflect participant voices, not researcher bias"
```

## Data Collection Methods

```yaml
Interviews:
  semi_structured:
    description: "Flexible interview guide, open-ended questions"
