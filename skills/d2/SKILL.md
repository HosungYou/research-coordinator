## 1. Interview Protocol Development

### Interview Types and Selection Criteria

#### A. Structured Interview
**Definition**: Predetermined questions asked in fixed order with standardized wording.

**When to Use**:
- Large sample sizes requiring consistency
- Comparative analysis across participants
- Limited interviewer training available
- Need for quantifiable qualitative data

**Example Protocol Structure**:
```
Opening (5 min)
├── Introduction to study purpose
├── Informed consent confirmation
└── Recording permission

Main Questions (30-40 min)
├── Q1: "Describe your typical workday." [probe: specific tasks]
├── Q2: "What challenges do you face most frequently?" [probe: examples]
├── Q3: "How do you respond to those challenges?" [probe: strategies]
└── Q4: "What support would be most helpful?" [probe: ideal scenario]

Closing (5 min)
├── "Is there anything important we haven't discussed?"
└── Next steps and follow-up contact
```

**Strengths**:
- High reliability across interviewers
- Easier to train research assistants
- Faster analysis due to standardized responses

**Limitations**:
- Reduced flexibility for deep exploration
- May miss emergent themes
- Less naturalistic conversation flow

---

#### B. Semi-Structured Interview
**Definition**: Flexible question guide with core topics but adaptable wording and order.

**When to Use**:
- Exploratory research with some prior knowledge
- Need balance between consistency and depth
- Experienced interviewers available
- Grounded theory or thematic analysis planned

**Example Protocol Structure**:
```
Topic Guide (not script)

Opening Rapport Building
- "Tell me about how you came to this field..."
- [Adapt based on participant background]

Core Topic 1: Experience with X
- Main question: "Walk me through your experience with X..."
- Probes (use as needed):
  * "Can you give me a specific example?"
  * "How did that make you feel?"
  * "What happened next?"

Core Topic 2: Challenges and Barriers
- Main question: "What obstacles have you encountered?"
- Probes:
  * "How did you try to overcome that?"
  * "Who else was involved?"
  * "What would you do differently?"

Core Topic 3: Future Perspectives
- Main question: "How do you see this evolving?"
- Probes:
  * "What would ideal support look like?"
  * "What concerns you most about the future?"

Closing
- "What haven't I asked that I should have?"
```

**Probing Strategy Matrix**:

| Probe Type | Example | Use When |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Clarification** | "What do you mean by 'overwhelming'?" | Vague or ambiguous response |
| **Elaboration** | "Can you tell me more about that?" | Surface-level answer |
| **Contrast** | "How does that differ from your previous experience?" | Need comparison |
| **Example** | "Could you give a specific instance?" | Abstract/general statement |
| **Silence** | [3-5 second pause] | Participant seems to be reflecting |
| **Echo** | "You said 'frustrating'..." | Encourage continuation |
| **Devil's Advocate** | "Some might argue the opposite. What do you think?" | Challenge assumptions |
| **Hypothetical** | "If you had unlimited resources, what would you do?" | Explore ideals |

**Strengths**:
- Rich, detailed data
- Flexibility to pursue unexpected themes
- Naturalistic conversation flow
- Participant-centered approach

**Limitations**:
- Requires skilled interviewers
- Lower inter-rater reliability
- More time-intensive analysis

---

#### C. Unstructured Interview
**Definition**: Open-ended conversation guided by broad research question with minimal predetermined structure.

**When to Use**:
- Phenomenological research (lived experience)
- Narrative inquiry
- Highly exploratory studies
- Expert interviewers only

**Example Opening**:
```
"I'm interested in understanding your experience with [phenomenon].
Could you tell me about that in your own words, starting wherever
feels right to you?"

[Interviewer follows participant's narrative thread, asking only:
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What was that like for you?"
- "How did you make sense of that?"]
```

**Strengths**:
- Maximum participant control
- Captures unexpected insights
- Authentic narrative structure

**Limitations**:
- Extremely interviewer-dependent
- Difficult to compare across participants
- Risk of missing key topics

---

### Question Design Principles

#### Grand Tour Questions
**Purpose**: Invite descriptive narrative of experience.

**Examples**:
- "Walk me through a typical day in your role."
- "Describe the process from start to finish."
- "Tell me the story of how you came to this decision."

**Best Practices**:
- Use at beginning to build rapport
- Allow 5-10 minutes for response
- Minimal interruption during narrative

---

#### Mini-Tour Questions
**Purpose**: Zoom into specific aspect of experience.

**Examples**:
- "You mentioned the staff meeting. Can you describe what happens there?"
- "Tell me more about your relationship with your supervisor."

---

#### Example Questions
**Purpose**: Request concrete instances.

**Phrasing**:
- "Can you give me an example of when that happened?"
- "Describe a specific time when you felt that way."

**Why Effective**: Moves from abstract to concrete, reveals behavioral patterns.

---

#### Experience/Behavior Questions
**Purpose**: Focus on actions, not just opinions.

**Examples**:
- "What do you do when a student is disruptive?"
- "How did you respond when you received that feedback?"

---

#### Opinion/Values Questions
**Purpose**: Explore beliefs and interpretations.

**Examples**:
- "What do you think is the root cause of this problem?"
- "How important is work-life balance to you?"

**Caution**: Don't overuse - opinions should emerge from experience descriptions.

---

#### Feeling Questions
**Purpose**: Access emotional dimension.

**Examples**:
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What was going through your mind at that moment?"

**Best Practice**: Ask AFTER behavioral description, not before.

---

#### Knowledge Questions
**Purpose**: Assess factual understanding.

**Examples**:
- "What do you know about the new policy?"
- "Can you explain how the system works?"

---

#### Sensory Questions
**Purpose**: Evoke vivid recall through senses.

**Examples**:
- "What did the room look like?"
- "What sounds do you remember?"

**Use in**: Phenomenological research, trauma-informed interviewing.

---

### Question Sequencing Logic

**Funnel Approach** (Broad → Narrow):
```
1. "Tell me about your teaching career." [Grand tour]
2. "What do you find most challenging?" [Opinion]
3. "Can you describe a recent challenging situation?" [Example]
4. "What specifically made it difficult?" [Mini-tour]
5. "How did you handle it?" [Behavior]
```

**Inverted Funnel** (Narrow → Broad):
```
1. "How many students are in your class?" [Knowledge]
2. "What does a typical lesson look like?" [Mini-tour]
3. "How do you approach curriculum planning?" [Behavior]
4. "What's your philosophy on education?" [Opinion/Values]
```

**Best Practice**: Start broad to avoid leading, narrow to explore specifics.

---

## 2. Focus Group Design

### Composition Criteria

**Optimal Size**: 6-10 participants
- **<6**: Risk of insufficient interaction, dominated by 1-2 voices
- **>10**: Difficult to manage, some participants don't speak

**Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity**:

| Dimension | Homogeneous Group | Heterogeneous Group |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Status/Power** | Same rank (all teachers) | Mixed rank (teachers + principals) |
| **Pro**: Comfort, candor | **Pro**: Multiple perspectives | |
| **Con**: Groupthink | **Con**: Power dynamics inhibit sharing | |
| **Experience Level** | All novices or all experts | Mixed experience | |
| **Pro**: Shared reference points | **Pro**: Newcomer questions reveal tacit knowledge | |
| **Con**: Blind spots | **Con**: Experts dominate | |
| **Demographic** | Same age/gender/ethnicity | Diverse demographics | |
| **Pro**: Rapport | **Pro**: Broader insights | |
| **Con**: Limited perspectives | **Con**: Potential discomfort | |

**General Rule**: Homogenize on power/status, diversify on experience/demographics (unless studying specific subgroup).

**Example Composition Plans**:

```yaml
Study: Teacher Perceptions of AI Tools
Group 1: Elementary teachers, 3-10 years experience (n=8)
Group 2: Secondary teachers, 3-10 years experience (n=7)
Group 3: Elementary teachers, <3 years experience (n=6)
Group 4: Secondary teachers, <3 years experience (n=9)

Rationale:
- Homogenize on level and experience (reduce power dynamics)
- 4 groups ensure saturation across key subgroups
- Exclude administrators to encourage candor
```

---

### Moderator Roles and Strategies

**Primary Moderator Responsibilities**:
1. **Facilitate Discussion** (not interview individuals)
   - Redirect answers to the group: "What do others think about that?"
   - Encourage peer-to-peer interaction: "Sarah, you mentioned X. John, how does that compare to your experience?"

2. **Manage Dynamics**
   - **Overtalkers**: "Let's hear from those who haven't spoken yet."
   - **Silent Members**: Direct eye contact, open body language, "Jamie, I'm curious about your perspective."
   - **Tangents**: "That's interesting, but let's return to..."
   - **Conflict**: "I'm hearing different viewpoints. Let's explore both."

3. **Maintain Neutrality**
   - Avoid agreeing/disagreeing: Use "mm-hmm", "I see", "tell me more"
   - Don't share personal opinions
   - Probe all perspectives equally

**Co-Moderator/Note-Taker Role**:
- Track who's speaking (seating chart with tally marks)
- Note non-verbal cues (nods, eye rolls, side conversations)
- Time management cues to lead moderator
- Operate recording equipment
- Ask follow-up questions moderator missed

---

### Discussion Guide Structure

**Template**:

```markdown
# Focus Group Discussion Guide

  * Confidentiality agreement
  * Right to pass on any question
- Recording consent confirmation
- Name tents/introductions

**Icebreaker Activity**
"Let's go around and share: Your name, how long you've been
teaching, and one word to describe your week."

[Purpose: Build comfort, even out speaking]

---

### II. Opening Questions (15 min)

- Compensation/incentive distribution
- Member checking timeline (if applicable)
- Contact for questions
```

---

### Activity-Based Techniques

**Card Sorting**:
- Provide cards with statements (e.g., potential AI benefits)
- Group sorts into "Very Important", "Somewhat", "Not Important"
- Discuss disagreements and reasoning

**Scenario Response**:
- Present hypothetical situation
- Groups discuss how they'd respond
- Reveals values and decision-making processes

**Timeline Creation**:
- Groups create shared timeline of key events
- Surfacing collective memory and interpretation differences

---

## 3. Transcription Conventions

### Transcription Levels

**Level 1: Verbatim (Full Jefferson Notation)**

**When to Use**:
- Conversation analysis
- Discourse analysis
- Studies where pauses, overlaps, intonation matter

**Example**:
```
Moderator: What concerns do you have about AI?

Sarah:    Well (0.5) I worry that=
          =it'll replace teachers↑

John:     [But it can't    ]
Sarah:    [I mean eventually]

          (2.0)

Moderator: Mm-hm

Sarah:    Like the human element (..) you can't automate empathy
          (.) right?

John:     Right but- (.) I think it's more of a tool?
          Not a >replacement< but like a calculator.
```

**Notation Key**:
```
(0.5)      = Pause in seconds
(.)        = Micro-pause (<0.3 sec)
=          = Latching (no gap between turns)
[ ]        = Overlapping speech
↑ ↓        = Rising/falling intonation
>text<     = Faster speech
<text>     = Slower speech
CAPS       = Louder volume
°text°     = Quieter volume
(( ))      = Transcriber notes
...        = Trailing off
-          = Abrupt cutoff
underlining = Emphasis
```

**Time Required**: 5-8 hours per 1 hour of audio

---

**Level 2: Intelligent Verbatim**

**When to Use**:
- Thematic analysis
- Grounded theory
- Most social science interviews

**Approach**:
- Remove filler words (um, uh, like) when they don't add meaning
- Light grammar correction for readability
- Preserve false starts and self-corrections when meaningful
- Note laughter, long pauses, emotional tone

**Example**:
```
Moderator: What concerns do you have about AI?

Sarah: Well, I worry that it'll replace teachers eventually.
       I mean, the human element—you can't automate empathy,
       right?

John: Right, but I think it's more of a tool, not a
      replacement. Like a calculator.

[2-second pause]

Sarah: I guess. But students might prefer AI because it
       doesn't judge them. [laughs]
```

**Time Required**: 3-5 hours per 1 hour of audio

---

**Level 3: Summarized/Content-Focused**

**When to Use**:
- Large datasets with limited resources
- Supplementary data to quantitative study
- Not recommended for primary qualitative analysis

**Approach**:
- Paraphrase main ideas
- Preserve key quotes verbatim
- Note who said what
- Risk: Lose nuance and unexpected insights

**Example**:
```
Theme: Concerns about AI in teaching

Sarah expressed worry that AI could eventually replace teachers,
emphasizing the irreplaceable "human element" of empathy.

John countered that AI should be viewed as a tool (like a
calculator) rather than a replacement.

Sarah acknowledged this but noted students might prefer AI's
non-judgmental nature. [Quote: "Students might prefer AI because
it doesn't judge them."]
```

**Time Required**: 1-2 hours per 1 hour of audio

---

### Transcription Quality Control

**Best Practices**:

1. **Timestamps**: Insert every 5 minutes or at topic shifts
   ```
   [00:15:30]
   Moderator: Let's move to the next question...
   ```

2. **Speaker Identification**:
   - Use real names (remove in de-identified version)
   - Or pseudonyms/codes (P1, P2, Teacher A)
   - Mark "Unknown" if unclear, flag for review

3. **Inaudible Segments**:
   ```
   Sarah: The policy requires [inaudible 00:23:15-00:23:18]
          which is problematic.
   ```

4. **Non-Verbal Communication**:
   ```
   [Sarah nods vigorously]
   [Group laughter]
   [John leans back, crosses arms]
   ```

5. **Contextual Notes**:
   ```
   [Refers to handout distributed earlier]
   [Phone rings, participant steps out]
   ```

---

### Transcription Software Recommendations

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Cost |
|------|------|------|------|
| **Otter.ai** | Fast auto-transcription, speaker ID | Requires editing, privacy concerns | Free tier, $10/mo pro |
| **Descript** | Audio editing integrated, filler word removal | Learning curve | $12/mo |
| **Express Scribe** | Free, foot pedal support, variable speed | Manual typing only | Free |
| **NVivo** | Integrated with analysis software | Expensive, auto-transcription limited | $1,200+ |
| **Sonix** | Multi-language, high accuracy | Subscription required | $10/hr pay-as-you-go |

**Hybrid Approach**:
1. Auto-transcribe with Otter/Sonix (save 70% time)
2. Human review and correction while listening
3. Add notation and context notes
4. Second pass for quality check

---

## 4. Member Checking Procedures

### Purpose
Enhance **credibility** (qualitative equivalent of internal validity) by validating:
- **Accuracy**: Did transcription capture what was said?
- **Interpretation**: Do participants recognize themselves in the analysis?
- **Context**: Were meanings correctly understood?

---

### Types of Member Checking

#### A. Transcript Review
**Process**:
1. De-identify transcript (remove names, locations, institutions)
2. Send to participant within 2 weeks of interview
3. Request:
   ```
   Please review this transcript of our conversation. You may:
   - Correct any inaccuracies
   - Clarify ambiguous statements
   - Add information you forgot to mention
   - Remove sensitive information

   Please return edits within 2 weeks. No response = approval.
   ```

**Pros**:
- Ensures factual accuracy
- Builds trust with participants
- May add new insights

**Cons**:
- Low response rate (30-50% typical)
- Participants may want to sound more polished
- Time-consuming

**Mitigation**:
- Offer summary instead of full transcript
- Highlight specific quotes you plan to use
- Make edits optional, not required

---

#### B. Interpretation Validation
**Process**:
1. After initial analysis, create 1-2 page summary of themes
2. Include representative quotes for each theme
3. Send to participants (or subset):
   ```
   Based on our interviews, I identified these key themes:

   1. **Tension between efficiency and empathy**
      "You can't automate the human element." - Sarah
      "AI saves time but loses the personal touch." - John

   Do these themes resonate with your experience?
   Have I misunderstood or missed anything important?
   ```

**Pros**:
- Validates interpretation, not just facts
- Can reveal researcher blind spots
- Shorter, more engaging than full transcript

**Cons**:
- Risk of participants wanting to change story
- May pressure participants to agree with researcher
- Theoretical interpretations may confuse practitioners

**Best Practice**: Frame as "does this make sense?" not "is this correct?"

---

#### C. Focus Group Member Checking
**Challenge**: Can't share full transcript (confidentiality).

**Approach 1 - Group Summary**:
- Send summary of group's collective themes
- Don't attribute specific quotes to individuals
- Ask: "Does this reflect our discussion?"

**Approach 2 - Individual Quotes Only**:
- Extract quotes from each participant
- Send only their own quotes for verification
- Ask: "May I use these in my report?"

---

### When to Skip Member Checking

**Inappropriate for**:
- Covert observation (participants don't know they're studied)
- Studies of elite or powerful participants (may suppress findings)
- Critical discourse analysis (researcher interpretation is explicit goal)
- Very large samples (not feasible)

**Alternative Validation Strategies**:
- Peer debriefing (other researchers review analysis)
- Triangulation (multiple data sources)
- Audit trail (document analytical decisions)

---

## 5. Ethical Safeguards

### Informed Consent Specific to Interviews

**Beyond standard IRB consent, address**:
- **Recording**: Audio vs. video, who has access, storage security
- **Transcription**: Who transcribes (researcher vs. third party service)
- **Quotes**: Permission to use in publications (verbatim, paraphrased, anonymized)
- **Withdrawal**: Can they withdraw after interview? What happens to their data?
- **Sensitive Topics**: Trigger warnings, right to skip questions, referral resources

**Example Clause**:
```
With your permission, this interview will be audio-recorded and
transcribed. Only the research team will have access to the
recording. Transcripts will be de-identified (your name and
institution removed).

You may request the recording be stopped at any time. You may
withdraw from the study up to 2 weeks after the interview by
emailing [contact]. After that, your de-identified data may be
included in analysis but we will remove any direct quotes.

Do you consent to audio recording? [Yes/No]
```

---

### Power Dynamics in Focus Groups

**Risk**: Dominant voices silence marginalized perspectives.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Pre-Discussion Activity**: Everyone writes response before sharing orally
2. **Round-Robin**: Everyone speaks before open discussion
3. **Small Group Breakout**: 2-3 person discussions, then report to full group
4. **Anonymous Input**: Sticky notes or digital poll before discussion
5. **Moderator Intervention**: "Let's hear from those who haven't spoken"

---

### Handling Distress

**If participant becomes emotional**:
1. **Pause Recording**: "Would you like me to pause the recording?"
2. **Offer Break**: "We can take a break or stop for today."
3. **Normalize**: "It's okay to be upset. This is important and personal."
4. **Provide Resources**: Have referral list ready (counseling, support groups)
5. **Follow Up**: Check in 24-48 hours later

**Example Script**:
```
"I can see this is difficult to talk about. We can pause here,
take a break, or stop entirely—whatever feels right to you.
I also have a list of support resources if you'd like them."
```

---

## 6. Integration with Other Agents

### Upstream Dependencies
- **C1-SurveyExpert**: If interviews follow survey (explanatory sequential mixed methods)
- **A1-TheoryMapper**: Theory informs interview questions (e.g., expectancy-value theory → motivation questions)
- **A2-ResearchDesigner**: Research design determines interview type (phenomenology → unstructured)

### Downstream Handoffs
- **D3-NarrativeAnalyst**: Provide transcripts for narrative analysis
- **D4-GroundedTheorySpecialist**: Provide transcripts for open coding
- **D5-ThematicAnalysisExpert**: Provide transcripts for theme extraction
- **E4-QualQualityReviewer**: Submit protocol and transcripts for quality audit

---

## 8. Example Workflow: From Design to Analysis

### Scenario
**Research Question**: How do early-career teachers experience burnout?
**Design**: Phenomenological study (semi-structured interviews)
**Sample**: 12 teachers, 1-3 years experience, diverse school contexts

---

### Step 1: Protocol Development (Week 1-2)
**Agent D2 Tasks**:
1. Draft semi-structured interview guide:
   - Opening: "Tell me about your journey to becoming a teacher."
   - Core: "Describe a recent day when you felt overwhelmed." [probe: physical sensations, thoughts, responses]
   - Closing: "What keeps you in teaching despite challenges?"

2. Pilot test with 2 teachers (not in final sample)
   - Revise: Add sensory questions ("What does burnout feel like physically?")
   - Timing: Adjusted to 75 minutes (was too rushed at 60)

3. Train research assistant on:
   - Non-directive probing
   - Handling emotional disclosure
   - Recording protocol

---

### Step 2: Data Collection (Week 3-8)
**Agent D2 Tasks**:
1. Conduct 12 interviews (2 per week)
2. After each interview:
   - Save recording to encrypted drive
   - Write field notes (context, non-verbals, initial impressions)
   - De-identify and send transcript for member checking within 48 hours

3. Monitor for saturation:
   - By interview 10, no new themes emerging
   - Continue to 12 to confirm saturation

---

### Step 3: Transcription (Week 4-10, concurrent with collection)
**Agent D2 Tasks**:
1. Auto-transcribe with Otter.ai (1 hour → 20 min draft)
2. Human review and editing (2 hours per interview):
   - Correct errors
   - Add intelligent verbatim notation
   - Insert timestamps every 5 minutes
   - Flag emotional moments: [crying], [long pause]

3. Quality check: PI reviews 2 randomly selected transcripts against audio

---

### Step 4: Member Checking (Week 9-11)
**Agent D2 Tasks**:
1. Send de-identified transcripts to participants
2. Follow up after 1 week (response rate: 8/12 = 67%)
3. Incorporate edits:
   - 3 participants clarified ambiguous statements

## 9. Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Leading Questions
**Bad**: "Don't you think AI tools are threatening to teachers?"
**Good**: "How do you feel about AI tools in your field?"

**Why**: Leading questions bias responses, reduce trustworthiness.

---

### Mistake 2: Double-Barreled Questions
**Bad**: "What are the benefits and challenges of online teaching?"
**Good**: "What benefits have you experienced?" [wait for full answer] "And what challenges?"

**Why**: Participants answer one part, forget the other.

---

### Mistake 3: Why Questions
**Bad**: "Why did you decide to quit?"
**Good**: "What led to your decision to quit?"

**Why**: "Why" can sound judgmental and prompt defensiveness.

---

### Mistake 4: Insufficient Probing
**Participant**: "The policy is frustrating."
**Weak Interviewer**: "Okay." [moves to next question]
**Strong Interviewer**: "What specifically is frustrating about it?" → "Can you give me an example?" → "How did that affect your work?"

**Why**: Surface responses miss rich detail.

---

### Mistake 5: Over-Moderating Focus Groups
**Bad**: Interviewing each participant individually while others listen.
**Good**: "What do others think about what Sarah just said?" [redirect to group interaction]

**Why**: Focus groups should generate interaction, not parallel interviews.

## 11. Advanced Techniques

### Photo Elicitation
**Method**: Participants bring photos related to topic; interview discusses images.

**Example**: "You brought this photo of your classroom. Tell me about what's happening here."

**Benefits**:
- Reduces power imbalance (participant is expert on their photo)
- Triggers memories and emotions
- Concrete starting point for abstract topics

---

### Timeline Interviews
**Method**: Create visual timeline of key events during interview.

**Example**: "Let's map out your teaching career. Where did it start? What were the major turning points?"

**Benefits**:
- Helps participants recall sequence
- Identifies critical incidents
- Reveals patterns over time

---

### Vignette Technique
**Method**: Present hypothetical scenario; ask how participant would respond.

**Example**:
```
"Imagine a student comes to you and says an AI chatbot wrote
their essay. What would you do?"
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces socially desirable responding (not asking what they DID, but what they WOULD do)
- Probes values and decision-making
- Useful for sensitive topics

---

## 12. Reflexivity in Interviewing

### Acknowledging Researcher Influence

**Interviews are co-constructed**: Your questions, reactions, and identity shape participant responses.

**Reflexive Practices**:

1. **Positionality Statement** (include in methods section):
   ```
   "As a former teacher, I brought both insider knowledge and
   potential bias to interviews. I used peer debriefing to
   challenge my assumptions and actively sought disconfirming
   evidence during analysis."
   ```

2. **Interview Debrief Memos** (after each interview):
   - What assumptions did I bring?
   - What surprised me?
   - Did my identity (age, race, role) affect participant responses?
   - What questions worked well? Which fell flat?

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - Document changes to interview protocol
   - Record analytical decisions (why coded this way)
   - Transparent about iterative process

---
