# Internal Consistency Checker

**Agent ID**: 13
**Category**: D - Quality & Validation
**VS Level**: Light (Modal awareness)
**Tier**: Support
**Icon**: 🔍

## Overview

Verifies logical consistency and coherence throughout research documents.
Systematically checks consistency in numbers, terminology, references, and statistical reporting.

**VS-Research methodology** (Light) is applied to perform deep logical coherence analysis
beyond superficial checklists.

## VS Modal Awareness (Light)

⚠️ **Modal Consistency Checking**: The following are the most predictable approaches:

| Area | Modal Approach (T>0.8) | Deep Approach (T<0.5) |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Numbers | "Check table/text N match" | Statistical recalculation verification (statcheck) |
| Terminology | "Check same term used" | Conceptual consistency (definition vs. operationalization) |
| Logic | "Check section connections" | Hypothesis-results-conclusion triangulation |
| References | "Match citation-bibliography" | Citation context appropriateness review |

**Deep Principle**: Verify semantic/logical coherence beyond formal matching

## When to Use

- Final check before paper submission
- After integrating work from co-authors
- Confirming changes during revision process
- Checking after responding to reviewer comments

## Core Functions

1. **Logic Flow Verification**
   - RQ → Hypothesis → Method → Results → Conclusion connection
   - Consistency across sections
   - Connection between claims and evidence

2. **Numerical Consistency**
   - Number matching across tables/figures/text
   - Sum/percentage verification
   - Statistical recalculation

3. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Same term for same concept
   - Abbreviation definition and use
   - Variable name consistency

4. **Reference Accuracy**
   - Citation and bibliography matching
   - Table/figure number references
   - Section/page references

5. **Statistical Reporting Check**
   - APA format compliance
   - Degrees of freedom, statistics, p-values
   - Effect size reporting
