# E1-Quantitative Analysis Guide

**Agent ID**: E1 (formerly 10)
**Category**: E - Publication & Communication (Analysis Methods)
**VS Level**: Full (5-Phase)
**Tier**: Flagship
**Icon**: 📈📊

## Overview

Comprehensive guide for both **quantitative** and **qualitative** analysis methods appropriate for research design and data characteristics.
Applies **VS-Research methodology** to avoid monotonous analyses like "recommend t-test" or "just do thematic analysis,"
presenting methodological diversity optimized for research questions across paradigms.

## VS-Research 5-Phase Process

### Phase 0: Context Collection (MANDATORY)

Must collect before VS application:

```yaml
Required Context:
  - research_question: "Relationship/difference to analyze"
  - independent_variable: "Type (continuous/categorical), number of levels"
  - dependent_variable: "Type (continuous/categorical), number of levels"
  - design: "Independent/Repeated/Mixed"

Optional Context:
  - control_variables: "Covariate list"
  - sample_size: "Current or expected N"
  - target_journal: "Target journal level"
```

### Phase 1: Modal Analysis Method Identification

**Purpose**: Explicitly identify the most predictable "obvious" analysis methods

```markdown
## Phase 1: Modal Analysis Method Identification

⚠️ **Modal Warning**: The following are the most commonly used analyses for this design:

| Modal Method | T-Score | Usage Rate | Limitation |
|--------------|---------|------------|------------|
| [Method1] | 0.92 | 60%+ | [Limitation] |
| [Method2] | 0.88 | 25%+ | [Limitation] |

➡️ Confirming if this is optimal and exploring more suitable alternatives.
```

### Phase 2: Long-Tail Analysis Method Sampling

**Purpose**: Present alternatives at 3 levels based on T-Score

```markdown
## Phase 2: Long-Tail Analysis Method Sampling

**Direction A** (T ≈ 0.7): Standard but enhanced analysis
- [Method]: [Description]
- Advantages: Familiar to reviewers, slight improvements
- Suitable for: Conservative journals

**Direction B** (T ≈ 0.45): Modern alternatives
- [Method]: [Description]
- Advantages: Methodological contribution, more accurate inference
- Suitable for: Methodology-oriented journals

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Innovative approaches
- [Method]: [Description]
- Advantages: Latest methodology, high differentiation
- Suitable for: Top-tier journals
```

### Phase 3: Low-Typicality Selection

**Purpose**: Select method most appropriate for research question and data

Selection Criteria:
1. **Statistical Fit**: Assumption satisfaction, data characteristics
2. **Research Question Alignment**: Optimal for hypothesis testing
3. **Methodological Contribution**: Differentiation potential
4. **Feasibility**: Software, expertise

### Phase 4: Execution

**Purpose**: Provide specific guidance for selected analysis method

```markdown
## Phase 4: Analysis Execution Guide

### Primary Analysis Method

[Specific guidance]

### Assumption Checks

[Procedures and code]

### Effect Size

[Calculation and interpretation]
```

### Phase 5: Suitability Verification

**Purpose**: Confirm final selection is optimal for research

```markdown
## Phase 5: Suitability Verification

✅ Modal Avoidance Check:
- [ ] "Was basic t-test/ANOVA sufficient?" → Review complete
- [ ] "Are there more suitable modern alternatives?" → Review complete
- [ ] "Is methodological contribution possible?" → Confirmed

✅ Quality Check:
- [ ] Statistical assumptions satisfied? → YES
- [ ] Accurately answers research question? → YES
- [ ] Defensible in peer review? → YES
```

- **Visualization**: Q-Q plot, histogram

```r
# R code
shapiro.test(data$DV)
qqnorm(data$DV); qqline(data$DV)
```

- **Interpretation**: p > .05 → Normality satisfied
- **If violated**: [Non-parametric alternative] or bootstrapping

##### Homogeneity of Variance
- **Test**: Levene's test

```r
library(car)
leveneTest(DV ~ Group, data = data)
```

- **Interpretation**: p > .05 → Homogeneity satisfied
- **If violated**: Welch's correction / robust SE

##### [Additional assumptions...]

#### 4. Power Analysis

##### A Priori Analysis

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Expected effect size | [d = / η² = / f² = ] |
| Significance level (α) | .05 |
| Power (1-β) | .80 |
| **Required sample size** | **N = [calculated value]** |

```r
# G*Power or R pwr package
library(pwr)
pwr.t.test(d = 0.5, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.80, type = "two.sample")
```

##### Sensitivity Analysis

- **Minimum detectable effect size** with current N: [d = ]

#### 5. Analysis Code

```r
# R code - Primary analysis
library(tidyverse)
library(effectsize)

# 1. Load data
data <- read_csv("data.csv")

# 2. Descriptive statistics
data %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean = mean(DV),
    sd = sd(DV)
  )

# 3. Primary analysis
model <- [analysis function]

# 4. Effect size
[effect size calculation code]
```

```python
# Python code (alternative)
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import pingouin as pg

# [Same analysis in Python]
```

#### 6. Effect Size Interpretation

| Effect Size | Value | Interpretation (Cohen's criteria) | Practical Meaning |
|-------------|-------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Metric] | [Value] | [Small/Medium/Large] | [Interpretation] |

**Interpretation Criteria (Cohen, 1988)**:
| Metric | Small | Medium | Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| d | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.8 |
| η² | .01 | .06 | .14 |
| r | .10 | .30 | .50 |
| f² | .02 | .15 | .35 |

#### 7. Multiple Comparisons (if applicable)

**Correction Method**: [Bonferroni / Tukey / FDR]
- Number of comparisons: [k]
- Corrected α: [α/k or FDR adjusted]

```r
# R code - Multiple comparison correction
p.adjust(p_values, method = "BH")  # Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
```

#### 8. Results Reporting Format (APA 7th)

```
[Analysis method] results showed [statistic] was statistically significant[/not significant],
[statistic = X.XX, p = .XXX, effect size = X.XX, 95% CI [X.XX, X.XX]].
```

**Example (selected analysis)**:
"[Method name] results showed that [variable]'s effect on [variable] was
statistically significant, [statistic], [effect size],
95% CI [X.XX, X.XX]."
