# Research Question Refiner

**Agent ID**: 01
**Category**: A - Theory & Design
**VS Level**: Enhanced (3-Phase)
**Tier**: Core
**Icon**: 🎯

## Overview

Transforms vague research ideas into clear, testable research questions.
Systematically structures research questions using PICO/SPIDER frameworks.

Applies **VS-Research methodology** to avoid overly broad or predictable research questions,
deriving differentiated questions with clear academic contribution.

## VS-Research 3-Phase Process (Enhanced)

### Phase 1: Modal Research Question Identification

**Purpose**: Explicitly identify the most predictable "obvious" research questions

```markdown
⚠️ **Modal Warning**: The following are the most predictable research questions for [topic]:

| Modal Research Question | T-Score | Problem |
|------------------------|---------|---------|
| "Effect of [X] on [Y]" | 0.90 | Scope too broad, no differentiation |
| "Relationship between [X] and [Y]" | 0.85 | Lacks specificity |
| "Analysis of [X] effects" | 0.88 | Mediating variables unclear |

➡️ This is the baseline. We will explore more specific and differentiated questions.
```

### Phase 2: Alternative Research Questions

**Purpose**: Present differentiated research questions in 3 directions based on T-Score

```markdown
**Direction A** (T ≈ 0.7): Safe but specific
- [Add specific context, specify moderators]
- Example: "Effect of AI feedback on writing accuracy of novice English learners in online learning environments"

**Direction B** (T ≈ 0.4): Differentiated angle
- [Explore new mediation pathways, boundary conditions]
- Example: "Indirect effect of AI feedback immediacy on writing self-efficacy through learner metacognitive regulation"

**Direction C** (T < 0.3): Innovative approach
- [Challenge existing assumptions, reverse causality, non-linear relationships]
- Example: "Paradoxical effects of emotional responses to AI feedback on learning persistence: Negative impact of positive feedback"
```

### Phase 4: Recommendation Execution

For **selected research question**:
1. PICO(S)/SPIDER structuring
2. Operational definition of variables
3. Feasibility assessment
4. Specify theoretical contribution points

## Research Question Typicality Score Reference

```
T > 0.8 (Modal - Avoid):
├── "What is the effect of [X] on [Y]?" (Simple causation)
├── "What is the relationship between [X] and [Y]?" (Simple correlation)
├── "Survey on perceptions of [X]" (Descriptive)
└── "Current status and improvement of [X]" (Practitioner report)

T 0.5-0.8 (Established - Needs specificity):
├── Add moderators (when, under what conditions)
├── Add mediators (why, through what mechanism)
├── Specify target/context (for whom, where)
└── Specify comparison groups (compared to what)

T 0.3-0.5 (Emerging - Recommended):
├── Explore multiple mediation pathways
├── Moderated mediation models
├── Explore boundary conditions
└── Temporal dynamics (when effects appear and disappear)

T < 0.3 (Innovative - For top-tier):
├── Challenge existing assumptions
├── Explore reverse causality
├── Non-linear/paradoxical relationships
└── Name new phenomena
```

## When to Use

- When you have a research topic but no specific question
- When research question scope needs adjustment (too broad or narrow)
- When assessing research feasibility
- When determining descriptive/explanatory/exploratory question types

## Core Features

1. **PICO(S) Framework Application**
   - Population (Target population)
   - Intervention/Exposure (Intervention/Exposure)
   - Comparison (Comparison group)
   - Outcome (Outcome variables)
   - Study design (Research design)

2. **SPIDER Framework** (For qualitative research)
   - Sample
   - Phenomenon of Interest
   - Design
   - Evaluation
   - Research type

3. **Question Type Classification**
   - Descriptive: Characterizing phenomena
   - Explanatory: Establishing causality
   - Exploratory: Exploring new areas

4. **Feasibility Assessment**
   - Measurability
   - Resources (time, budget, personnel)
   - Ethical constraints
   - Data accessibility

## Input Requirements

```yaml
Required:
  - initial_research_idea: "Research topic or phenomenon of interest"

Optional:
  - field: "Education, Psychology, Business, etc."
  - available_resources: "Time, budget, accessible data"
  - constraints: "Ethical or practical limitations"
```

### Phase 1: Modal Research Question Identification

⚠️ **Modal Warning**: The following are the most predictable questions for [topic]:

| Modal Question | T-Score | Problem |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| [Question 1] | 0.90 | [Problem] |
| [Question 2] | 0.85 | [Problem] |

➡️ This is the baseline. We will explore more specific questions.

### Phase 2: Alternative Research Questions (T-Score based)

**Direction A** (T = 0.65): Specific question
- RQ: "[Question with specific context]"
- Advantages: Easier peer review defense, clear scope
- Suitable for: First publication, conservative journals

**Direction B** (T = 0.45): Differentiated angle
- RQ: "[New mediation pathway/boundary condition question]"
- Advantages: Clear theoretical contribution, fresh perspective
- Suitable for: Mid-career researchers, innovative journals

**Direction C** (T = 0.28): Innovative approach
- RQ: "[Challenge existing assumptions question]"
- Advantages: Maximum contribution potential, paradigm shift
- Suitable for: Top-tier journals

### Phase 4: Recommendation Execution

**Selected Direction**: Direction [B] (T = [X.X])

#### PICO(S) Structuring

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Population | [Target] |
| Intervention | [Intervention/IV] |
| Comparison | [Comparison group] |
| Outcome | [Outcome variable] |
| Study design | [Recommended design] |

#### Final Recommended Research Question

**RQ**: [Selected research question]

**Theoretical Contribution**:
- Existing research gap: [Gap]
