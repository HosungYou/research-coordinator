# Changelog

All notable changes to NovaScholar (formerly NovaScholar) will be documented in this file.

## [5.0.0] - 2025-01-25 (Sisyphus Edition)

### Overview

NovaScholar v5.0.0 represents a major architectural redesign, expanding from 21 to 27 agents across 8 categories (A-H). This release introduces the Sisyphus continuation enforcement pattern, automatic paradigm detection, and comprehensive support for qualitative and mixed methods research.

**Core Theme**: "Beyond Modal - Creative, Defensible Research Choices"

### Project Renamed: NovaScholar → NovaScholar

This release marks the **official renaming** of the project to **NovaScholar** to better reflect its core mission:

- **"Nova"** = New star, new discovery, beyond the obvious
- **Breaking free from mode collapse** through Verbalized Sampling (VS) methodology
- **T-Score system** for rating typicality of recommendations (0-1 scale)
- **5 Creativity Mechanisms**: Forced Analogy, Iterative Refinement, Semantic Distance, Temporal Reframing, Community Simulation

### New Features

#### Verbalized Sampling (VS) Methodology

NovaScholar's **core innovation** that prevents mode collapse:

| T-Score | Interpretation | NovaScholar Behavior |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| `T > 0.8` | Modal (predictable) | ⚠️ Flags and warns about differentiation |
| `T 0.5-0.8` | Established alternative | ✅ Suggests as balanced choice |
| `T 0.3-0.5` | Emerging approach | ✅ Recommends for innovation |
| `T < 0.3` | Novel/creative | 🔬 Presents with strong rationale |

#### Sisyphus Protocol

### New Features

#### Sisyphus Protocol

Adopted from oh-my-opencode, the Sisyphus protocol enforces continuation until verified completion:

- **Continuation Enforcement**: Research work never stops until paradigm-specific completion criteria are met
- **Verification Before Completion**: Every claim of "done" requires fresh evidence
- **Paradigm-Specific Criteria**: Different completion checklists for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods

**Completion Criteria by Paradigm**:

| Paradigm | Key Criteria |
|----------|-------------|
| Quantitative | Hypotheses tested, power analysis done, effect sizes reported, visualizations generated |
| Qualitative | Saturation documented, themes refined, trustworthiness criteria met, member checking completed |
| Mixed Methods | Both strands complete, integration strategy documented, joint display created, meta-inference generated |

#### Paradigm Auto-Detection

Automatic detection of research paradigm based on conversation keywords:

- **Quantitative Signals**: "hypothesis", "effect size", "p-value", "ANOVA", "regression", "가설", "효과크기"
- **Qualitative Signals**: "lived experience", "saturation", "themes", "phenomenology", "체험", "포화"
- **Mixed Methods Signals**: "sequential", "convergent", "integration", "joint display", "혼합방법"

#### Smart Model Routing (Updated)

| Tier | Model | Agent Types |
|------|-------|-------------|
| HIGH | Opus | Complex interpretive work, philosophical reasoning (A2, A5, C2, C3, E2, E3, H1-H4) |
| MEDIUM | Sonnet | Standard research tasks (A1, A3, A4, B1, B2, C1, C4, D1-D4, E1, E4, F2, F4, G2, G3) |
| LOW | Haiku | Quick lookups, formatting, checklists (B3, B4, F1, F3, G1, G4) |

| 🟡 OPTIONAL | CP_VISUALIZATION_PREFERENCE, CP_RENDERING_METHOD | Defaults available |

### Validation

All 33 agents pass contract validation:

```bash
python scripts/validate_agents.py
# Summary: 33/33 agents passed validation
# ✅ All agents passed validation!
```

### Breaking Changes

- Agent IDs changed from numeric (01-21) to include category-based (A1-H4)
- Some agents split or renamed (see Extended Agents section)
- New required frontmatter fields: `upgrade_level`, `v3_integration`

### Migration from v4.x

1. **Agent Registry**: The 21 agents remain with original IDs; new agents use category IDs (A5, C2-C4, D1-D4, E2-E3, H1-H4)
2. **Paradigm Detection**: Automatically activates appropriate agent packs
3. **Sisyphus Protocol**: All workflows now include verification-before-completion
4. **Frontmatter**: All SKILL.md files require `upgrade_level` and `v3_integration` fields

## [3.2.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added

#### OMC (oh-my-claudecode) Integration
- **21 OMC Agent Definition Files** (`.omc/agents/research/01-21`)
  - Each agent has: tier, model, category, parallel_group, human_checkpoint, triggers
  - Follows OMC agent specification format

- **Human Checkpoint System** (`.omc/checkpoints/`)
  - `checkpoint-definitions.yaml`: 7 checkpoints across 3 levels
    - 🔴 REQUIRED: CP_RESEARCH_DIRECTION, CP_THEORY_SELECTION, CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL
    - 🟠 RECOMMENDED: CP_ANALYSIS_PLAN, CP_QUALITY_REVIEW
    - 🟡 OPTIONAL: CP_VISUALIZATION_PREFERENCE, CP_RENDERING_METHOD
  - `checkpoint-handler.md`: Implementation protocol for checkpoint handling
  - `parallel-execution-rules.yaml`: 10 parallel execution groups with checkpoint boundaries

- **Model Routing Configuration** (`.omc/config/research-coordinator-routing.yaml`)
  - HIGH tier (Opus): #01, #02, #03, #09, #19 - Strategic decisions
  - MEDIUM tier (Sonnet): #04, #06, #10, #12, #15-18, #20, #21 - Standard analysis
  - LOW tier (Haiku): #05, #07, #08, #11, #13, #14 - Search, calculation, code

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md**: Added OMC Integration v3.2.0 section
- **SKILL.md**: Updated to v3.2.0 with OMC integration, model routing table, checkpoint references

### Core Principle

> **"인간이 할 일은 인간이, AI는 인간의 범주를 벗어난 것을 수행"**
> (Human decisions MUST be respected, AI only handles tasks beyond human scope)

### Compatibility

- **Backwards Compatible**: Works with Claude Code alone (no OMC required)
- **Enhanced with OMC**: Parallel execution, smart model routing, token efficiency
