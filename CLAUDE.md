## v6.0 Clean Slate Changes

| Change | v5.0 (Sisyphus) | v6.0 (Human-Centered) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Sisyphus Protocol** | "Work never stops" | ❌ REMOVED |
| **Iron Law** | "agent OR checkpoint" | ❌ REMOVED |
| **ralph/ultrawork/ecomode** | Autonomous modes | ❌ REMOVED |
| **Human Checkpoints** | Could be bypassed | ✅ MANDATORY |
| **Model Routing** | haiku/sonnet/opus | ✅ KEPT |
| **VS Methodology** | Creative alternatives | ✅ ENHANCED |

---

## Project Overview

Diverga provides **context-persistent research support** through **33 specialized agents** across 8 categories (A-H). Unlike other AI tools that suffer from **mode collapse** (always recommending the same predictable options), Diverga uses **Verbalized Sampling (VS) methodology** to guide you toward creative, defensible research choices while maintaining research context across the entire project lifecycle in a single platform.

## Core Value Proposition

1. **Human-Centered**: AI assists, humans decide at EVERY critical point
2. **Beyond Modal**: VS methodology prevents mode collapse - creative alternatives, not obvious choices
3. **Context Persistence**: No re-explaining your research question, methodology, or decisions
4. **Single Platform**: Claude Code as your unified research environment
5. **Research Pipeline**: Structured workflow from idea to publication
6. **Tool Discovery**: Easy access to tools/platforms you didn't know existed

> **Core Principle**: "Human decisions remain with humans. AI handles what's beyond human scope."
> "인간이 할 일은 인간이, AI는 인간의 범주를 벗어난 것을 수행"

---

## Quick Start

Simply tell Diverga what you want to do:

```
"I want to conduct a systematic review on AI in education"
"메타분석 연구를 시작하고 싶어"
"Help me design an experimental study"
```

The system will:
1. Detect your paradigm
2. **ASK for confirmation** (🔴 CHECKPOINT)
3. Present VS alternatives with T-Scores
4. **WAIT for your selection**
5. Guide you through the pipeline with checkpoints

## Human Checkpoint System (v6.0 Core Feature)

### Checkpoint Types

| Level | Icon | Behavior |
|-------|------|----------|
| **REQUIRED** | 🔴 | System STOPS - Cannot proceed without explicit approval |
| **RECOMMENDED** | 🟠 | System PAUSES - Strongly suggests approval |
| **OPTIONAL** | 🟡 | System ASKS - Defaults available if skipped |

### Required Checkpoints (🔴 MANDATORY)

| Checkpoint | When | What Happens |
|------------|------|--------------|
| CP_RESEARCH_DIRECTION | Research question finalized | Present VS options, WAIT for selection |
| CP_PARADIGM_SELECTION | Methodology approach | Ask Quantitative/Qualitative/Mixed |
| CP_THEORY_SELECTION | Framework chosen | Present alternatives with T-Scores |
| CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL | Design complete | Detailed review required |

### Checkpoint Behavior

## VS Methodology (Enhanced in v6.0)

### T-Score (Typicality Score)

| T-Score | Label | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| >= 0.7 | Common | Highly typical, safe but limited novelty |
| 0.4-0.7 | Moderate | Balanced risk-novelty |
| 0.2-0.4 | Innovative | Novel, requires strong justification |
| < 0.2 | Experimental | Highly novel, high risk/reward |

### VS Process with Human Decision

```
Stage 1: Context & Modal Identification
  └─ Identify "obvious" recommendations

Stage 2: Divergent Exploration
  ├─ Direction A (T~0.6): Safe but differentiated
  ├─ Direction B (T~0.4): Balanced novelty ⭐
  └─ Direction C (T<0.3): Innovative/experimental

Stage 3: Human Selection (🔴 CHECKPOINT)
  ├─ Present ALL options with T-Scores
  ├─ WAIT for human decision
  └─ Execute ONLY selected direction
```

## Paradigm Detection (Auto-Activation + Confirmation)

### Auto-Detection Triggers

**Quantitative signals:** "hypothesis", "effect size", "p-value", "experiment", "ANOVA", "regression", "가설", "효과크기", "통계"

**Qualitative signals:** "lived experience", "saturation", "themes", "phenomenology", "coding", "체험", "포화", "현상학"

**Mixed methods signals:** "sequential", "convergent", "integration", "joint display", "혼합방법", "통합"

### Confirmation (Always Ask)

When paradigm is detected, **ALWAYS ask for confirmation**:

```
"연구 맥락에서 [양적 연구] 접근이 감지되었습니다.
이 패러다임으로 진행해도 될까요?

 [Q] 예, 양적 연구로 진행
 [L] 아니요, 질적 연구로 변경
 [M] 아니요, 혼합방법으로 변경
 [?] 잘 모르겠어요, 도움이 필요해요"
```

## Humanization Pipeline (v6.1 New Feature)

### Overview

Transform AI-generated academic text into natural, human-sounding prose while preserving scholarly integrity. Based on Wikipedia's AI Cleanup initiative's 24 pattern categories, adapted for academic writing.

### Pipeline Stages

```
Content Generation (G2/G3) → G5 Analysis → Checkpoint → G6 Transform → F5 Verify → Export
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `"Check AI patterns"` | Run G5 analysis, show pattern report |
| `"Humanize my draft"` | Full pipeline with balanced mode |
| `"Humanize (conservative)"` | Minimal changes, high-risk only |
| `"Humanize (aggressive)"` | Maximum naturalness |
| `"Export with humanization"` | Run pipeline before export |

### Transformation Modes

| Mode | Target | Best For |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Conservative** | High-risk patterns only | Journal submissions |
| **Balanced** ⭐ | High + medium-risk | Most academic writing |
| **Aggressive** | All patterns | Blog posts, informal |

### New Checkpoint

| Checkpoint | Level | When |
|------------|-------|------|
| CP_HUMANIZATION_REVIEW | 🟠 Recommended | After content generation |
| CP_HUMANIZATION_VERIFY | 🟡 Optional | Before final export |

### Ethics Note

Humanization helps express ideas naturally—it does NOT make AI use "undetectable."
Researchers should follow institutional and journal AI disclosure policies.

## What Was Removed in v6.0

### ❌ Sisyphus Protocol
- **Was**: "Work never stops until complete"
- **Problem**: Bypassed human checkpoints
- **Now**: AI stops at every checkpoint and waits

### ❌ Iron Law of Continuation
- **Was**: "Move to next agent OR human checkpoint"
- **Problem**: "OR" made checkpoints optional
- **Now**: Checkpoint THEN next agent (sequential)

### ❌ OMC Autonomous Modes
- **Removed**: ralph, ultrawork, autopilot, ecomode
- **Problem**: These modes enabled checkpoint bypass
- **Kept**: Model routing (haiku/sonnet/opus) only
