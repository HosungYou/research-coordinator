## 🎯 Overview

Research Coordinator is a specialized AI assistant system that supports the complete research lifecycle through **21 context-aware agents**. Built on Claude Code Skills, it maintains project context from initial question formulation through to publication.

### What Makes This Different?

**Context Persistence Across Research Lifecycle** - Unlike general AI tools that require re-explaining your research every conversation, Research Coordinator maintains:
- Your research question and theoretical framework
- Methodological decisions and their rationale
- Literature search strategies and results
- Analysis plans and intermediate findings
- Review history and revision decisions

All in a single platform, accessible throughout your project.

## ✨ New in v4.0.0

### 🗂️ Project State Management
Persistent research context stored in `.research/project-state.yaml`:
```yaml
research_question: "How do AI chatbots improve speaking skills?"
theoretical_framework: "Social Cognitive Theory"
methodology: "Systematic Review (PRISMA 2020)"
stage: "Stage 3: Screening"
```

### 📋 Pipeline Templates
Pre-configured workflows for common research types:
- **PRISMA 2020 Systematic Review** (7-stage workflow)
- **Meta-Analysis** (quantitative synthesis)
- **Experimental Studies** (RCT/Quasi-experimental)
- **Survey Research** (design to analysis)

### 🔗 Integration Hub
Direct connections to research tools:
- **Zotero MCP**: Reference management in Claude Code
- **Semantic Scholar API**: Automated literature retrieval
- **Nanobanana**: Gemini-powered data visualization
- **Office Suite**: Excel/Word/PowerPoint generation
- **R/Python**: Statistical analysis code

### 🧭 Guided Wizard
Conversational research setup using `AskUserQuestion` tool:
- Clear choice points with clickable options
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Context-aware suggestions
- Validation at each step

### 📄 Auto-Documentation
Automatic generation of:
- PRISMA 2020 flow diagrams (Mermaid)
- Data extraction spreadsheets (Excel)
- Conference presentations (PowerPoint)
- Method sections (Word)
- Analysis scripts (R/Python)

### Verify Installation
```bash
claude plugin list | grep research-coordinator
```

Expected output:
```
❯ research-coordinator@research-coordinator-skills
  Version: 4.0.0
  Status: ✔ enabled
```

## 📖 Usage

### Natural Language Interface

Simply describe what you want to do:

```
"I want to conduct a systematic review on AI in education"
→ Activates PRISMA 2020 pipeline template

"메타분석 연구를 시작하고 싶어요"
→ Launches meta-analysis workflow (Korean support)

"Help me design an experimental study comparing two interventions"
→ Guides through experimental design wizard
```

### Master Skill Command

```bash
/research-coordinator
```

The master skill analyzes conversation context and automatically dispatches appropriate agents.

### Direct Agent Invocation

```bash
/theoretical-framework-architect    # Theory selection
/systematic-literature-scout        # PRISMA search
/statistical-analysis-guide         # Analysis planning
/journal-matcher                    # Publication targeting
```

### Auto-Trigger Example

```
User: "Planning a meta-analysis on effectiveness of AI tutoring systems"

Claude: [Auto-detected: "meta-analysis", "effectiveness"]
        → Activating agents:
          #05 Systematic Literature Scout
          #07 Effect Size Extractor
          #10 Statistical Analysis Guide
        → Initializing PRISMA 2020 workflow...
```

## 🧠 VS-Research Methodology (v3.0)

**Verbalized Sampling (VS)** prevents AI "mode collapse" - the tendency to always recommend the same obvious options.

### Dynamic T-Score (Typicality Score)

All recommendations include 0-1 typicality scores:

| T-Score | Interpretation | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `T > 0.8` | Modal (most common) | ⚠️ Avoid for differentiation |
| `T 0.5-0.8` | Established alternative | ✅ Safe choice |
| `T 0.3-0.5` | Emerging approach | ✅ Innovative, justifiable |
| `T < 0.3` | Creative/novel | ⚠️ Requires strong rationale |

### 5 Creativity Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Forced Analogy** | Borrow concepts from distant fields | "TAM → Ecosystem Theory" |
| **Iterative Loop** | 3-5 refinement cycles | "Initial → Improved → Optimized" |
| **Semantic Distance** | Explore conceptually distant ideas | "Learning effect → Neuroplasticity" |
| **Temporal Reframing** | Shift temporal perspective | "10-year retrospective view" |
| **Community Simulation** | Simulate scholarly debate | "Conservative vs. Innovative scholars" |

### 14 User Checkpoints

| Code | Checkpoint | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| CP-INIT-001 | Initial context confirmation | Research field/experience level |
| CP-INIT-002 | Goal clarification | Research objectives/expected outcomes |
| CP-VS-001 | Modal awareness check | Acknowledge modal options |
| CP-VS-003 | Final choice confirmation | Approve recommendation |
| CP-FA-001 | Forced analogy validation | Check analogy appropriateness |
| CP-IL-001 | Iteration loop gate | Continue refinement? |
| CP-SD-001 | Semantic distance validation | Confirm concept expansion |

### VS Application Levels

| Level | Agents | Description | Mechanisms |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **FULL** | 02, 03, 05, 10, 16 | Complete VS process | All 5 |
| **ENHANCED** | 01, 04, 06, 07, 08, 09 | Streamlined VS | FA, IL, SD |
| **LIGHT** | 11-15, 17-20 | Modal awareness + alternatives | None |

### Example: Avoiding Mode Collapse in Theory Selection

```
❌ Before VS (Mode Collapse):
   "For AI adoption research, I recommend TAM." (every time)

✅ After VS v3.0:
   [CP-INIT-001] Context check: Learning motivation study, prefers innovation

   Phase 1 - Modal Identification:
   "TAM (T=0.92) and UTAUT (T=0.85) are the most predictable choices."
   [CP-VS-001] Modal awareness confirmed

   Phase 2 - Creativity Mechanisms:
   [Forced Analogy] "Adaptive Learning Ecosystem" from ecological theory
   [Semantic Distance] "Plasticity" from neuroscience applied to learning

   Options:
   - Direction A (T≈0.6): Self-Determination Theory × TAM integration
   - Direction B (T≈0.4): Cognitive Load Theory + Adaptive Ecosystem
   - Direction C (T≈0.2): Neuroplasticity-based learning framework
   [CP-FA-001] Analogy appropriateness validated

   Phase 3 - Contextual Recommendation:
   [CP-VS-003] "For your context, Direction B (T=0.4) is recommended. Proceed?"
```

## 🔧 Core Principle: Human-AI Division of Labor

> **"Human decisions remain with humans. AI handles what's beyond human scope."**
> **"인간이 할 일은 인간이, AI는 인간의 범주를 벗어난 것을 수행"**

### What Humans Decide
- Research direction and theoretical stance
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria for studies
- Interpretation of findings
- Ethical trade-offs
- Publication strategy

### What AI Handles
- Searching 20,000+ papers across databases
- Calculating inter-rater reliability
- Generating PRISMA flow diagrams
- Extracting effect sizes from tables
- Formatting references to journal style

**All AI recommendations include checkpoints for human validation.**
