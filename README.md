## 🌟 Why "Nova"? Breaking Free from Mode Collapse

Most AI research assistants suffer from **mode collapse** - they always recommend the same predictable options:

> ❌ "For technology adoption, I recommend TAM." (every single time)
> ❌ "For your meta-analysis, use random effects model." (always)
> ❌ "Try thematic analysis for your qualitative study." (the obvious choice)

**NovaScholar is different.** Built on **Verbalized Sampling (VS) methodology** (arXiv:2510.01171), it actively prevents mode collapse and guides you toward **creative, defensible research choices**.

---

## 🧠 Core Innovation: Verbalized Sampling (VS) Methodology

### The Problem: Modal Recommendations

AI systems tend to recommend the most statistically common options - what we call **modal recommendations**. While safe, these lead to:
- Homogenized research landscapes
- Missed innovative opportunities
- Difficulty differentiating your work

### The Solution: Dynamic T-Score System

NovaScholar assigns **Typicality Scores (T-Score)** to all recommendations:

| T-Score | Interpretation | NovaScholar Behavior |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| `T > 0.8` | **Modal** (most common) | ⚠️ Flags as "predictable" - warns about differentiation |
| `T 0.5-0.8` | **Established alternative** | ✅ Suggests as balanced choice |
| `T 0.3-0.5` | **Emerging approach** | ✅ Recommends for innovation with justification |
| `T < 0.3` | **Novel/creative** | 🔬 Presents with strong rationale required |

### 5 Creativity Mechanisms

NovaScholar uses five cognitive mechanisms to generate non-obvious options:

| Mechanism | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Forced Analogy** | Borrow concepts from distant fields | "Apply ecosystem theory to technology adoption" |
| **Iterative Refinement** | 3-5 cycles of improvement | "Initial → Improved → Optimized framework" |
| **Semantic Distance** | Explore conceptually distant ideas | "Connect learning motivation to neuroplasticity" |
| **Temporal Reframing** | Shift temporal perspective | "How will this look in 10 years?" |
| **Community Simulation** | Simulate scholarly debate | "What would critics vs. innovators say?" |

### VS in Action: Before vs. After

```
❌ WITHOUT VS (Mode Collapse):
   User: "Help me choose a theoretical framework for AI adoption study"
   AI: "I recommend Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)."
   (Same answer every time, T=0.92)

✅ WITH VS (NovaScholar):
   User: "Help me choose a theoretical framework for AI adoption study"

   NovaScholar: "Let me analyze options across the typicality spectrum:

   [Modal Awareness] TAM (T=0.92) and UTAUT (T=0.85) are predictable choices.
   Most reviewers expect these, but they offer limited differentiation.

   [Forced Analogy Applied] From ecological theory:
   → 'Adaptive Learning Ecosystem' framework (T=0.35)

   [Semantic Distance Applied] From neuroscience:
   → 'Cognitive Plasticity in Technology Use' model (T=0.28)

   Recommended Options:
   • Direction A (T≈0.6): Self-Determination Theory × TAM integration
   • Direction B (T≈0.4): Cognitive Load Theory + Adaptive Ecosystem
   • Direction C (T≈0.2): Neuroplasticity-based technology learning

   For your context (innovative journal, novel contribution needed),
   I recommend Direction B. Shall I elaborate?"
```

## 🎯 What Makes NovaScholar Different

### 1. **Creative Guidance, Not Just Answers**
NovaScholar doesn't just answer questions - it expands your thinking by showing options you didn't know existed.

### 2. **Context Persistence**
Unlike general AI tools, NovaScholar maintains your research context:
- Research question and theoretical framework
- Methodological decisions and rationale
- Literature search strategies and results
- Analysis plans and intermediate findings

### 3. **27 Specialized Agents**
Expert agents for every research phase, from question formulation to publication.

### 4. **Paradigm-Aware**
Automatic detection of quantitative/qualitative/mixed methods with appropriate agent activation.

### 5. **Sisyphus Protocol**
Never claims completion without verification evidence.

## 🔬 VS Application Levels

Different agents apply VS at different intensities:

| Level | Agents | VS Mechanisms | Use Case |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **FULL** | A2, A4, B1, E1, E3, F4, H1, H2 | All 5 mechanisms + checkpoints | Theory selection, analysis design |
| **ENHANCED** | A1, A3, A5, B2-B4, C1-C4, D1-D4, E2 | FA, IL, SD + modal awareness | Design, data collection |
| **LIGHT** | E4, F1-F3, G1-G4 | Modal awareness only | Code generation, checklists |

### 14 User Checkpoints

NovaScholar confirms decisions at critical points:

| Code | Checkpoint | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| CP-INIT-001 | Initial context | Research field, experience level |
| CP-VS-001 | Modal awareness | Acknowledge predictable options |
| CP-VS-003 | Final choice | Approve selected approach |
| CP-FA-001 | Forced analogy | Validate cross-domain concepts |
| CP-IL-001 | Iteration gate | Continue refinement? |
| CP-SD-001 | Semantic distance | Confirm concept expansion |

## ✨ v5.0.0 (Sisyphus Edition)

### Sisyphus Protocol: Continuation Enforcement
Research tasks must be **completed** before moving on:
- **Agent-Based Orchestration**: Work delegated to specialized agents
- **Paradigm-Aware Completion**: Different criteria for quant/qual/mixed
- **Iron Law**: NO completion claims without fresh evidence

### Paradigm Detection & Agent Packs
Automatic detection activates appropriate agent sets:

| Paradigm | Auto-Detected Keywords | Agent Pack |
|----------|------------------------|------------|
| **Quantitative** | "effect size", "meta-analysis", "statistical power" | A1-A5, C1, E1, E4 |
| **Qualitative** | "phenomenology", "grounded theory", "thematic" | A1-A5, C2, D2, E2 |
| **Mixed Methods** | "convergent", "sequential", "joint display" | All 27 agents |

### Full Qualitative Research Support (NEW)
- **Phenomenology**: Bracketing, essence identification, meaning units
- **Grounded Theory**: Open/axial/selective coding, theoretical saturation
- **Case Study**: Thick description, pattern matching
- **Ethnography**: Fieldwork protocols, cultural interpretation
- **Action Research**: PDSA cycles, participatory engagement

### Mixed Methods Integration (NEW)
- Joint Display Tables
- Meta-Inference Generation
- Convergent/Sequential Design Support
