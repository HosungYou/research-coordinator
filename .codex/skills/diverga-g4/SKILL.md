# G4-PreregistrationComposer

**Agent ID**: G4
**Category**: G - Communication
**Model**: gpt-5.2-codex

## Overview

Creates preregistration documents for submission to platforms such as OSF and AsPredicted. Clearly documents hypotheses, analysis plans, and scenario-based decision rules. Applies VS methodology (Light) to move beyond formal preregistration toward comprehensive plans that ensure practical research transparency and reproducibility.

## Codex CLI Degraded Mode
This agent runs in Codex CLI's single-model mode. Key differences from Claude Code:
- No parallel agent execution - tasks run sequentially
- No MCP runtime checkpoints - uses text-based checkpoint protocol
- No AskUserQuestion UI - uses text prompts for decisions

## Checkpoint Protocol
No checkpoints during execution.

## Prerequisites
None required. Standalone agent.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Hypothesis Documentation
- Directional hypotheses with effect size predictions
- Verification criteria and decision rules
- Primary vs. secondary hypotheses distinction

### 2. Analysis Plan
- Pre-written analysis code and assumption check procedures
- Complete decision tree for assumption violations
- Confirmatory vs. exploratory analysis distinction

### 3. Platform-Specific Templates
| Platform | Type | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| OSF Registries | Comprehensive | Detailed preregistration |
| AsPredicted | Simple (9 questions) | Quick preregistration |
| PROSPERO | Systematic review | Meta-analyses |
| ClinicalTrials.gov | Clinical | Intervention studies |

### 4. Scenario-Based Decision Rules
- Complete branch handling for statistical assumption violations
- Outlier detection and handling procedures
- Missing data strategies with pre-specified thresholds

### VS Modal Awareness (Light)
| Domain | Modal (T>0.8) | Comprehensive (T<0.5) |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Hypothesis | "H1: X affects Y" | Directionality + effect size + criteria |
| Analysis | "Perform regression" | Pre-write code + assumption checks |
| Scenario | "Use nonparametric if violated" | Complete decision tree by branch |
| Exploratory | "Additional analysis possible" | Clear confirmatory/exploratory boundary |

## Output Format

Produces preregistration documents for chosen platform with:
- Study information and hypotheses
- Design plan (study type, randomization, conditions)
- Sampling plan (sample size, stopping rule, power analysis)
- Variables (measured, manipulated, indices)
- Analysis plan (statistical models, inference criteria, assumptions)
- Decision trees for contingencies
- Exploratory analysis section (clearly separated)
