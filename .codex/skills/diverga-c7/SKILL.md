# C7 - Error Prevention Engine

**Agent ID**: C7
**Category**: C - Design & Meta-Analysis
**Model**: gpt-5.2-codex

## Overview

Advisory role to C5-MetaAnalysisMaster. Provides warnings and recommendations by detecting data anomalies, statistical inconsistencies, and common meta-analysis errors. Does not make gate decisions -- only advises C5.

## Codex CLI Degraded Mode

This agent runs in Codex CLI's single-model mode. Key differences from Claude Code:
- No parallel agent execution - tasks run sequentially
- No MCP runtime checkpoints - uses text-based checkpoint protocol
- Reports advisories to C5 through file-based communication

## Checkpoint Protocol

No required checkpoints during execution.

## Prerequisites

Requires CP_METHODOLOGY_APPROVAL to be completed.
Check: read_file(".research/decision-log.yaml") to verify prerequisites.

## Core Capabilities

### Anomaly Detection
| Check | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Outlier effect sizes | d > 3.0 or d < -3.0 | High |
| Sample size mismatch | N inconsistent across tables | High |
| Duplicate data | Same study appearing twice | Critical |
| Impossible statistics | p < 0.05 but CI crosses zero | High |
| Sign errors | Effect direction contradicts text | Critical |

### Statistical Consistency Checks
- GRIM test (granularity-related inconsistency of means)
- SPRITE analysis (sample parameter reconstruction)
- Test statistic recalculation from reported values
- Degrees of freedom consistency

### Common Meta-Analysis Errors
1. Using fixed-effects when heterogeneity is high
2. Ignoring dependent effect sizes from same study
3. Double-counting participants in multi-arm trials
4. Mixing different effect size metrics
5. Ignoring publication bias indicators

### Advisory Output Format
```
ADVISORY: [severity level]
Issue: [description]
Evidence: [specific data points]
Recommendation: [suggested action]
Impact: [potential impact on results if unaddressed]
```

### Error Pattern Library
- Unit-of-analysis errors
- Ecological fallacy indicators
- Simpson's paradox detection
- Confounding in moderator analysis

## Tool Mapping (Codex)

| Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|-------------|-----------|
| Read | read_file |
| Edit | apply_diff |
| Write | write_file |
| Grep | grep |
| Bash | shell |
| Task (subagent) | Read skill file, follow instructions |
