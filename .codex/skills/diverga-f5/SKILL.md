# F5-HumanizationVerifier

**Agent ID**: F5
**Category**: F - Quality
**Model**: gpt-5.1-codex-mini

## Overview

Verifies that humanization transformations maintain academic integrity, preserve critical elements, and actually reduce AI detectability. This is the final quality gate before humanized content is exported. Takes original and humanized text, runs 5 verification checks, and produces a pass/fail report.

## Codex CLI Degraded Mode
This agent runs in Codex CLI's single-model mode. Key differences from Claude Code:
- No parallel agent execution - tasks run sequentially
- No MCP runtime checkpoints - uses text-based checkpoint protocol
- No AskUserQuestion UI - uses text prompts for decisions

## Checkpoint Protocol
No prerequisites required for entry.

### Checkpoints During Execution
- CP_HUMANIZATION_VERIFY (Optional): After verification, ask user to approve export, review changes, or revert.

When reaching a checkpoint:
1. STOP and clearly mark: "CHECKPOINT: CP_HUMANIZATION_VERIFY"
2. Present options: [A] Approve and export, [B] Review specific changes, [C] Revert to original
3. WAIT for user response before continuing
4. Log decision: write_file(".research/decision-log.yaml") to record

## Prerequisites
None required for standalone use. Typically runs after G6-AcademicStyleHumanizer.

## Core Capabilities

### 5 Verification Checks

1. **Citation Integrity** - Count match, format preserved, content accurate, placement logical
2. **Statistical Accuracy** - All p-values, effect sizes, sample sizes, test statistics, percentages, CIs unchanged
3. **Meaning Preservation** - Main findings preserved, conclusions unchanged, no new causal language, hedge appropriateness
4. **AI Pattern Reduction** - Re-runs G5 analysis: compare AI probability and pattern counts before/after
5. **Academic Tone** - Formality, objectivity, precision, consistency maintained

### Verification Strictness Levels
| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Low | Basic citation count, statistical presence, major meaning changes only |
| Medium (Default) | Full citation verification, statistical comparison, meaning analysis, AI check |
| High | Deep citation context, statistical formatting, sentence-level meaning, tone consistency |

### Error Handling
- **Critical Failures (Auto-Reject)**: Citation missing/altered, statistic modified, meaning reversed
- **Warnings (Flag for Review)**: Hedge changed, emphasis shifted, structure altered, low AI reduction
- **Acceptable**: Vocabulary substitution, phrase simplification, punctuation normalization, transition variation

## Output Format

Produces a Humanization Verification Report with:
- Summary table: 5 checks with Pass/Fail status
- Overall Verdict: APPROVED / REVIEW NEEDED / REJECTED
- Detailed results per check
- Flagged items for review
- Checkpoint for user approval before export
